contiguous or adjacent thereto, the immediate acquisition of which property
and franchises, if any, is determined by the Council to be necessary to
serve the public convenience through the provision of adequate omnibus
transportation, notwithstanding the fact that such property and franchises,
if any, were or are devoted to a public use. Such power of condemnation
shall be subject to the provisions of § 5-a of the Condemnation Law,1 except

§ 1-6 ROCHESTER CODE § 1-7
C:6
A certified copy of an ordinance of the Council authorizing any such
acquisition and identifying the property and franchises, if any, to be
acquired shall be filed in the office of the County Clerk of the County
of Monroe. A petition for an order vesting title to such property and
franchises, if any, in the City, setting forth the action had by the Council,
a description of the property and franchises, if any, to be acquired and
a prayer that title to such property and franchises, if any, be vested
in such city, shall then be presented, upon notice of the application to
condemn published in five successive issues of the official publication of
the City, to a special term of the Supreme Court within the judicial district
in which the property being acquired is situated held at the time and
place specified in such notice. Such proceedings shall have precedence
over all other cases on the calendar in said Court, any other provision
of law to the contrary notwithstanding. Upon due proof of satisfaction to
the Court of the filing of the ordinance as hereinabove described, such
Court, not later than three days after the presentation of the petition, shall
thereupon enter an order vesting title to such property and franchises, if
any, in the City. Upon such vesting of title, the City shall have the right
to enter upon and take possession of such property. Written notice of the
petition shall be given to the owners of all property and franchises, if any,
affected by the proceedings at least three days prior to the date specified
in such notice for the presentation to the Court of such petition by personal
service or by registered mall to such owners at their last known addresses.
Such published and written notices shall indicate the real and personal
property and franchises, if any, to be taken by a general description and
by references to the aforementioned ordinance of the Council. Except as
herein otherwise prescribed, the procedures for the ascertainment of the
compensation to be paid to the owners of property or franchises, if any,
so acquired shall be, so far as practicable, the procedures governing the
acquisition by the City of real property located in the City.
Notwithstanding the provisions of any general, special or local law to the
contrary, the City may authorize, issue and sell obligations, pursuant to the
Local Finance Law, to pay for the cost of any acquisition or acquisitions
of such property used and usable in the operation of omnibus lines. The
maximum period of probable usefulness for each such object or purpose for
which obligations may be issued hereunder is hereby determined to be as
follows:
A. The acquisition of real property, 30 years.
B. The acquisition of omnibuses and other necessary personal property,
10 years.
C. The acquisition of franchises, if any, five years.

PART B
Judicial Warrants for Inspections of Premises
§ 1-9. Purpose and authority. [§ 1, L.L. No. 3-2009]
In order to promote the health and safety of its residents and visitors,
the City enforces numerous laws relating to the construction, alteration,
maintenance, repair, operation, use, condition or occupancy of a premises.
These laws include laws such as the New York State Uniform Fire
Prevention and Building Code, which the City is required to enforce on
behalf of the state. In many instances, enforcement is possible only through
inspections conducted in or on the premises itself. Most owners and
occupants of a premises consent to necessary inspections and, when
violations are found, promptly make corrections necessary to bring the
premises into compliance with applicable codes. However, the City has
recently encountered increasing numbers of owners and/or occupants who
do not allow, fail to schedule, or unduly delay inspections. The City has
particularly found this to be the case in the enforcement of provisions
significantly affecting the health or safety of City tenants, such as the Lead-
Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Code, found in Article III of Chapter 90,
the Property Conservation Code. The City cannot allow the enforcement
of these important health and safety codes to rest upon the desires of the
owner or occupant of the premises. The enforcement of these provisions
is especially important to a large number of residents of the City, such
as children, the disabled and the elderly, who may be unable to recognize
the dangers in their premises or to take the necessary steps to protect
themselves. The United States Supreme Court and the New York State
Court of Appeals have recognized the right of persons to require a warrant
for inspections of premises in certain circumstances and have established
standards for the issuance of such warrants. While New York Courts have
issued warrants for the inspection of premises on the basis of the Supreme
Court and New York Court of Appeals decisions and have applied in part
the procedures for search warrants established in the Criminal Procedure
Law, New York State statutes do not establish specific procedures or
requirements for the issuance of warrants for inspections of premises. In
the absence of state statutes, the City wishes to establish guidelines which
meet constitutional requirements for the issuance by the courts of judicial
warrants for the inspection of premises within the City. Such guidelines
are particularly appropriate in the City due to absentee ownership of a
significant number of premises, the age of City housing, and the difficulty
in obtaining consent for necessary inspections. The guidelines will provide
a process for issuing such warrants and will apprise landlords, tenants and
all persons of the procedures and requirements to be followed by the City in
obtaining and executing inspection warrants. These provisions will promote
the health, safety and welfare of the City and all of its residents and visitors.
Authority for the adoption of such guidelines is found in, but not limited to,
the home rule and police powers found in Article IX, Section 2, of the New
York State Constitution, § 10 of the Municipal Home Rule Law and § 20 of
the General City Law and are necessary for the proper administration and
enforcement by the City of the Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code
§ 1-9 CHARTER OF THE CITY OF ROCHESTER § 1-9

of the premises has been submitted, and the occupants and/or the
owner have not allowed, have failed to schedule, or have unduly
delayed the inspection of the premises; or

§ 1-23. Issuance of an inspection warrant. [§ 1, L.L. No. 3-2009]
has been given, which most recent notice shall have been given within
90 days of the application for the inspection warrant, and how the
inspection has not been allowed, has not been scheduled, or has been
unduly delayed by the person notified;
G. State facts based upon personal knowledge of the applicant or upon
information and belief, provided that in the latter event the sources of

provided, however, that this provision shall not prevent the
issuance of an inspection warrant in circumstances where there

(5) Identify the premises to be entered and inspected in sufficient

A. Preamble. Officers and employees of the City of Rochester shall hold
their positions to serve and benefit the public and not for personal gain
or advantage. The City Council recognizes that in order to implement
this fundamental principle there is a need for clear and reasonable
standards of ethical conduct. This Code of Ethics establishes such
standards by defining and prohibiting acts incompatible with the public
interest. The City Council also recognizes that compliance with ethical
standards rests primarily on personal integrity, and further recognizes
that integrity of City officers and employees generally. However, in
order that the offending case be discerned with certainty and corrected
quickly, this Code of Ethics also establishes a Board of Ethics, which
shall render opinions with respect to the code and compliance with the
ethical standards set forth herein. Finally, the City Council recognizes
that City officers and employees have a right of privacy and a right to
share in the normal benefits of the democratic society they serve and
the economy to which they contribute; therefore, this Code of Ethics is
not intended and should not be interpreted to intrude unreasonably
upon the privacy of any officer or employee or to deny to any officer or
employee the right to participate in government programs open to the
public generally.
B. Definitions. When used in this code, the following words and phrases
shall have the following meanings:
New York in Mains v. City of Rochester, 03-CV-6363T(F), 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 14826

School District shall serve as Mayor or a member of the City Council. An officer or
employee of the Rochester City School District must vacate said office or employment
prior to the effective date of his or her position as Mayor or member of the City Council,
or the City office becomes vacant. If the Mayor or a member of City Council accepts an
office or employment with the Rochester City School District, the City office becomes
vacant."

§ 2-18 ROCHESTER CODE § 2-18
C:38
(1) No City officer or employee shall have any employment, or engage
in any business or commercial transaction, or engage in any
professional activity, or incur any obligation, as a result of which,
directly or indirectly, he or she would have an interest that would
impair his or her independence of judgment or action in the
performance of his or her official duties or that would be in conflict
with the performance of his or her official duties.
(2) No City officer or employee shall have or enter into any contract
with any person who has or enters into a contract with the City
unless:
(a) The contract between the person and the City is awarded
pursuant to the competitive bidding procedures of the General
Municipal Law; or
(b) The contract between the person and the City is one with
respect to which the City officer or employee:
[1] Has no interest;
[2] Has no duties or responsibilities, or, if the contract with
the person is one which the City officer or employee
entered into prior to becoming a City officer or employee,
he or she abstains from any performance of duties or
responsibilities; and
[3] Exercises or attempts to exercise no influence.
(c) While disclosure is required, no prohibited conflict of interest
shall be found involving a contract with a person, firm,
corporation or association in which a City officer or employee
has an interest which is prohibited solely by reason of
employment as an officer or employee thereof, if the
remuneration of such employment will not be directly affected
as a result of such contract and the duties of such employment
do not directly involve the procurement, preparation or
performance of any part of such contract.
(3) No City officer or employee shall discuss, vote on, decide or take
part in, formally or informally, any matter proposed or pending
before any agency or other City officer or employee in which he or
she has an interest. This provision shall not apply to any City officer
or employee whose interest in the proposed or pending matter is
minimal, provided that these procedures are followed strictly:
(a) The City officer or employee shall identify his or her interest,
that is, the benefit or advantage that would be gained or lost if
the City acts on the matter in various ways, and the underlying
basis of it, such as ownership, an investment, a contract or
claim, employment or a relationship, if any.
§ 2-18 CHARTER OF THE CITY OF ROCHESTER § 2-18
C:39
(b) The City officer or employee shall completely and specifically
describe and disclose his or her interest and its underlying
basis, if any, in writing, to his or her immediate superior and
the Chairperson of the Board of Ethics in advance of his or her
participation in the matter.
(c) If either the City officer or employee or his or her immediate
superior or the Chairperson of the Board of Ethics thinks that
the disclosure reasonably raises a question whether the
interest is minimal, the question shall be submitted to the
Board of Ethics for an opinion, prior to which the officer or
employee shall not participate in the matter. Failure to disclose
property or abide by the opinion of the Board of Ethics shall
make any participation of the officer or employee in the matter
null and void.
(4) No City officer or employee, acting in the performance of his or her
official duties, shall treat, whether by action or omission to act, any
person more favorably than it is the custom and practice to treat
the general public.
(5) No City officer or employee shall use or permit the use of cityowned
vehicles, equipment, materials or property for the
convenience or profit of himself or herself or any other person.
(6) No City officer or employee shall solicit any gift, nor shall any City
officer or employee accept or receive any gift having a value of $75
or more, regardless of the form of the gift, from any person who has
an interest in any matter proposed or pending before any City
agency. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to
contributions solicited or received in accordance with the Election
Law of the State of New York. [§ 1, L.L. No. 3-2018]
(7) No City officer or employee shall disclose without proper
authorization nonpublic information or records concerning any
aspect of the government of the City, nor shall be or she use such
information to the advantage or benefit of himself or herself or any
other person.
(8) No City officer or employee privy to nonpublic information
regarding the allocation of City funds or having direct influence or
control over the allocation of City funds shall be a director, officer
or trustee of any organization which receives, from or through the
City, funds that constitute 10% or more of the organization's annual
operating and capital budget, except where appointment to such
position is approved by a duly adopted resolution of the City
Council.
(9) No City officer or employee shall own in person or through an agent
or broker, or be a principal in any corporation, partnership or other
business entity which owns, any real property within the City of
§ 2-18 ROCHESTER CODE § 2-18
C:40
Rochester that is in violation of City or state laws or regulations.
Property shall be deemed to be in violation when a reasonable and
proper notice and order to correct violations duly issued has not
been obeyed in a timely manner.
(10)No City officer or employee compensated by the City for such
service shall represent any person in any action or proceeding,
whether judicial or administrative, to which the City is a party, or
before any City agency or other City officer or employee. This
provision shall not apply to the Corporation Counsel when
representing persons within the scope of official duties. This
provision also shall not apply to members of the Board of
Assessment Review, hearing officers, arbitrators or mediators
compensated by the City for such services, who shall instead be
covered by Subsection C(11) below; or to outside counsel hired by
the City where the Corporation Counsel determines that the
outside counsel, or the outside counsel's firm, does not have an
interest in conflict with that of the City.
(11)No City officer or employee who serves the City without
compensation, or member of the Board of Assessment Review,
hearing officer, arbitrator or mediator compensated by the City,
shall represent any person before the agency he or she serves or
before any other City officer or employee who regularly serves the
agency he or she serves or before any other agency on merits
directly involving the agency he or she serves.
(12)No former City officer or employee shall at any time after he or she
leaves the agency he or she served represent a person before any
agency on a specific matter with which he or she was directly
involved or of which he or she has special knowledge, if the
representation would be adverse to the position of the City on the
matter. The Corporation Counsel may seek an injunction to enforce
the provisions of this subsection.
(13) The provisions of this section, including disclosure provisions in
Subsection G hereof, shall not apply to a contract with a
corporation in which a municipal officer or employee has an
interest by reason of stockholdings when less than five per centum
of the outstanding stock of the corporation is owned or controlled
directly or indirectly by such officer or employee.
(14) While disclosure and recusal shall be required, the interest of a
City officer or employee who is a member of the board of a not-forprofit
corporation or association which has a contract with the City
shall not be prohibited where the remuneration of such City officer
or employee will not be directly affected as a result of such
contract.

prescribed herein.
2. The Mayor, candidates for Mayor, Members of City Council,
candidates for City Council and senior management shall complete
the financial disclosure statement that is designated for elected
officials, candidates and senior management. All other officers and
employees designated pursuant to Subsection G(1) shall complete
the financial disclosure statement that is designated for unelected
officers and employees not in senior management. The completed
financial disclosure statement shall contain the prescribed
information with respect to each person covered by Subsection 1,
as well as the spouse of the person and any unemancipated child of
the person. For this purpose, "spouse" shall mean any individual
married to (and not legally separated from) or living with the
person required to file, and "unemancipated child" shall mean any
son or daughter, any stepson or stepdaughter (with or without
formal adoption), any foster child or any individual for whom the
person required to file or such person's spouse serves as guardian
who is unmarried, living in the home of the person required to file
or living at school and claimed as an exemption on the federal
income tax return of the person required to file or such person's
spouse. [§ 1, L.L. No. 6-2018]
3. Completed financial disclosure statements shall be filed with the
Secretary of the Board of Ethics of the City of Rochester, which
shall be the repository for such statements. The Secretary shall
advise, in writing, each person required to file of such filing
requirement at least 15 days prior to the deadline for filing, except
that the Secretary shall so advise persons required to file as
candidates at least five days prior to the deadline for filing. Failure
of the Secretary to so advise shall not relieve any person required
to file of the obligation to file in a timely manner. Such statements
shall be filed by April 15 each year, containing the prescribed
information relating to the previous calendar year. New City
§ 2-18 ROCHESTER CODE § 2-18
C:46
officers or employees hired between March 15 and December 31
shall file such statements within 30 days of the effective date
of their employment. Candidates for Mayor or City Council who
are not currently Mayor, a Member of City Council, or senior
management shall file such statements within seven days of the
last day allowed by law for the filing of designating or nominating
petitions, whichever is applicable and earlier in each candidate's
case. Extensions of time to file may be granted by the Secretary
upon written application of a person required to file showing
justifiable cause or undue hardship, except that as to City officers
and employees, no extension shall be granted for longer than 60
days, and as to candidates, no extension shall be granted for longer
than 20 days. [§ 1, L.L. No. 6-2018]
4. The Board shall permit any person required to file a financial
disclosure statement to apply, prior to the expiration of the time for
filing or any extension thereof, for an exemption from any
requirement to report one or more items of information which
pertain solely to such person's spouse or any unemancipated child,
which item(s) may be exempted by the Board upon a finding by a
majority of the total number of members of the Board without
vacancy that the person's spouse, on his or her own behalf or on
behalf of an unemancipated child, objects to reporting the item(s)
of information, and that the item(s) of information have no material
bearing on the discharge of the person's official duties.
5. The Secretary of the Board shall review filed financial disclosure
statements within 30 days of the filing date to ascertain whether
any person required to file such statement has either failed to file
or has filed a deficient statement. If a person required to file a
statement has failed to file or appears to have filed a deficient

Mayor or the President shall notify the person, in writing,
specifying the possible violation or enclosing a copy of the
complaint, and shall provide the person with a fifteen-day period in
which to submit a written response to the possible or alleged
violation. Thereafter, if the Mayor or the President determines that
a further inquiry is warranted, the matter shall be referred to the
person's appointing authority, who may impose discipline,
including removal, in the manner provided by law, subject to
judicial review if and to the extent applicable; provided, however,
that as to members of the City Council, the matter shall be referred
by the President to the full Council for proceedings pursuant to

any capacity, whether compensated or not, or for a term fixed or not
fixed, including, without limit, persons serving on a temporary, parttime
or seasonal basis, persons paid with funds derived from other than

or as a City representative on a non-city board, commission or
committee, subject to the proviso contained in Subsection H, but shall
not extend to such boards, commissions or committees as entities. The

18.Editor's Note: This local law also relettered former Subsection H as Subsection I.
§ 2-19 ROCHESTER CODE § 2-23
C:50
phrase shall include former City employees but shall not include
independent contractors.
B. The City shall pay reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees at rates
prevailing in the local legal community, disbursements and litigation
expenses incurred by a City employee in his or her defense in a criminal
proceeding in a state or federal court arising out of any act or omission
that occurred while the employee was exercising or performing his or
her powers and duties within the scope of his or her public employment,
as determined by the Corporation Counsel. The City employee shall be
entitled to private counsel of his or her own choice, except that the
Corporation Counsel may require that appropriate groups of City
employees be represented by the same private counsel. This duty to pay
for a defense in a criminal proceeding shall arise only upon the
complete acquittal of a City employee or the dismissal of all criminal
charges against him or her; this duty shall not extend to grand jury
proceedings, except a grand jury proceeding in which an on-duty use of
a weapon by a member of the Rochester Police Department is being
investigated and in which a no-bill is reported. Attorneys' fees,
disbursements and litigation expenses shall be submitted by the
attorney within 30 days after acquittal or dismissal to the Corporation
Counsel, in the manner and form required by him or her, and shall be
reviewed and approved by him or her prior to payment. The
determination of the Corporation Counsel in this regard shall be final.
C. The City shall defend a City employee in any civil action or proceeding
before any state or federal court or administrative agency seeking any
type of relief, including compensatory or punitive damages arising out
of any act or omission that occurred while the employee was exercising
or performing and, as to punitive damages, was properly discharging
his or her powers and duties within the scope of his or her public
employment, as determined by the Corporation Counsel. This duty to
provide for a defense shall not arise where the action or proceeding
against the employee is brought by or at the behest of the City itself.
D. The Corporation Counsel shall have the duty to defend or may employ
special counsel to defend the City employee in any civil action or
proceeding unless the Corporation Counsel determines that an actual
conflict of interest exists, in which case the Corporation Counsel shall
prepare a list of no fewer than three private attorneys from which the
City employee may select private counsel of his or her choice, except
that the Corporation Counsel may require that appropriate groups of
City employees be represented by the same private counsel. The
selections of the Corporation Counsel in preparing such a list shall be
made so as to ensure that private counsel has a type and level of
professional experience appropriate to the subject matter of the case,
that such counsel has no conflict of interest with the City, that such
counsel is prepared to act in the closest cooperation with the
Corporation Counsel consistent with standards of professional
responsibility and that such counsel has agreed to terms of
§ 2-23 CHARTER OF THE CITY OF ROCHESTER § 2-23
C:51
compensation established by the Corporation Counsel and to honor all
provisions of this section of the Charter. The Corporation Counsel may,
solely as an exercise of discretion, consider and include on the list
an attorney requested by the City employee to be defended. If special
counsel is employed, the City shall pay reasonable and necessary
attorneys' fees, at rates established at the time of employment or of
assembly of the list, as well as disbursements and litigation expenses
incurred by a City employee in his or her defense. Attorneys' fees,
disbursements and litigation expenses shall be submitted by the
attorney promptly after the end of each month to the Corporation
Counsel, in the manner and form required by him or her, and shall
be reviewed and approved by him or her prior to payment. The
determination of the Corporation Counsel regarding fees,
disbursements and expenses shall be final.
E. The City shall indemnify and save harmless a City employee in the
amount of any judgment obtained against the employee in a state or
federal court or administrative agency or in the amount of any
settlement of a claim, in the nature of compensatory or punitive
damages, provided that the employee's act(s) or omission(s) underlying
the judgment or settlement occurred while the employee was
exercising or performing and, as to punitive damages, was properly
discharging his or her powers and duties within the scope of his or her
public employment, as determined by the Corporation Counsel. This
duty to indemnify and save harmless shall not arise where a judgment is
obtained or a claim settled as a result of an action or proceeding
brought by or at the behest of the City itself.
F. In making the determinations required by Subsections B, C and E of
this section, the Corporation Counsel may utilize the cumulative
information available to him or her at the time he or she makes the
determination, including but not limited to any allegations, any type of
records or any examinations or investigations by whomever conducted.
With respect to Subsection B, the Corporation Counsel shall make his or
her determinations within 60 days of complete acquittal or dismissal or
all criminal charges. With respect to Subsections C and E, the
Corporation Counsel shall make his or her determination at or before
the time to file or serve an answer in a civil action or proceeding; a
determination favorable to the City employee may thereafter be
revoked by the Corporation Counsel, no later than the start of trial, only
if the City employee, with respect to any material and relevant acts or
omissions, lied in any investigation of the underlying incident upon
which the Corporation Counsel relied in making his or her original
determination and the truth causes the Corporation Counsel to revise
his or her original determination. The Corporation Counsel's
determination, original or revised, shall be in writing and served
promptly upon the City employee, and if a determination is adverse to
the City employee, it shall state the facts and reasons therefor. A special
proceeding brought pursuant to Article 78 of the New York Civil
Practice Law and Rules shall be the exclusive method by which a City
§ 2-23 ROCHESTER CODE § 2-23
C:52
employee aggrieved by a determination of the Corporation Counsel
may seek judicial review of the determination. If, as a result of such
judicial review, the City employee ultimately obtains a reversal of the
Corporation Counsel's determination, the City shall reimburse the
employee for his or her attorneys' fees and costs in obtaining the
reversal, provided that such fees and costs are reasonable and
necessary according to prevailing practices and standards in the legal
community as determined by the Corporation Counsel, subject to
judicial review.
G. The duties to defend or to pay for a defense and to indemnify and save
harmless shall be conditioned upon delivery by a City employee to the
Corporation Counsel of any notice, summons, complaint or any other
legal process within three business days after he or she is served with
such document, the full and truthful response by the employee in any
and all City investigations into the incident(s) and transaction(s) upon
which the action or proceeding is predicated and the full cooperation of
a City employee in the defense of any action or proceeding against him
or her or against the City based upon his or her alleged acts or
omissions and in the taking of any appeals.
H. The duties to pay for or to provide a defense and to indemnify and save
harmless a compensated City employee serving ex officio or as a
designated City representative on a non-city board, commission or
committee shall be secondary and supplemental to any obligation to
defend and indemnify and any liability insurance provided the City
employee by the non-city entity on which the City employee serves.
I. This local law shall not in any way impair any powers of the Corporation
Counsel granted by the City Charter, City Code and any other law. The
Corporation Counsel shall have complete charge of the defense in any
civil action or proceeding and shall have sole authority to defend or
settle any action or proceeding or to take, not take or withdraw any
appeal, in the manner he or she deems appropriate.

C:63
Upon receipt of the Mayor's proposed budget estimate and the budget
estimate of the Board of Education, the Council shall consider the
same and give a public hearing to all persons wishing to be heard
in reference thereto. The Council may increase, decrease or reject
any item contained in the estimate received from the Mayor, except
items relating to indebtedness, judgments and estimated revenues;
but the individual salaries and wages of officers and employees shall
not, for this purpose, be regarded as separate items. The Council
may increase, diminish or reject any item contained in the estimate
received from the Board of Education, except for fixed charges for
which the City is liable.
After the public hearing and on or before the 20th day of June of
each year, the Council shall adopt the estimates as submitted, or as
amended, and pass an appropriation ordinance.
If no additions are made by the Council, the budget, as passed by it,
shall be deemed to have been adopted without any action of the Mayor;
reductions to the proposed budget do not require the approval of the
Mayor. If, however, the budget as passed by the Council contains any
additions, it must be presented by the City Clerk to the Mayor for
approval. If the Mayor approves all the additions, the Mayor shall affix
his or her signature to a statement thereof and return the budget and
such statement to the City Clerk. The budget, including the additions
as part thereof, shall then be deemed to have been adopted.
The Mayor may object to any one or more of such items and in such
case shall append to the budget a statement of the added items to
which he/she objects with the reasons for his or her objections. The
Mayor shall return the budget with objections to the City Clerk on or
before the 25th day of June. The Council shall thereupon enter the
objections upon its journal and proceed to reconsider the additions so
objected to, only one vote being taken for each reconsideration.
If upon such reconsideration, 2/3 of all members of Council vote to
approve such additions, or any of them, these additions, together with
those not objected to by the Mayor, are so adopted, provided that
additions to the budgets of the City Council or the City Clerk's Office
objected to by the Mayor may be adopted upon reconsideration by a
majority vote of Council. If the budget with additions is not returned
by the Mayor to the City Clerk with objections on or before the 25th
day of June, it shall be deemed to have been approved.
If a budget has not been adopted, as herein provided, on or before the
30th day of June each year, then the budget as submitted by the Mayor,
including all additions to which the Mayor has failed to object, shall be
the budget for the ensuing fiscal year.
The Mayor shall submit quarterly reports to the Council comparing
actual revenues and expenditures to the revenue and expenditure
estimates provided in the operating budget.

Rochester arising from the existence, maintenance or use of City sewer

unanimous vote, authorize the Director of Finance to pay said claim in

An ordinance of the Council altering the name of a public street or highway,
or changing the legally established grade of a public street or highway, or
discontinuing a public street or highway, must be passed by a vote of ¾ of all
the members thereof. When lands have been used by the public as a street
or highway for more than one year, the Council may by ordinance declare
the same to be a public street and fix the width and location thereof, and
such location may be fixed by reference to the map hereinafter directed to
be filed. Such ordinance is presumptive evidence that the lands included
within the street, as therein located, or a portion thereof, have been used
by the public as a street or highway for more than one year. A copy of such
ordinance must thereupon be recorded, and a map of said street as located
filed in the County Clerk's office, and said ordinance published at least twice
in the official paper with a notice requiring all persons having or claiming
to have any right, title or interest in, or lien upon, the lands included in said
street, to file their claims for compensation therefor with the Corporation
Counsel. An ordinance locating a street does not waive any rights of the
City, and is not to be construed as an admission that such street, or any part
thereof, was not previously a public street, or that any person is entitled to
compensation for the lands included therein.
Any change in the width or location of a street not requiring a change of the
Official Map or Plan, and any change in the direction of traffic on a street or
the grade of a street shall be approved by an ordinance of the Council after
notice of a public hearing has been published at least five days prior to the
public hearing. Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring
approval of the Council for the resurfacing of a street.

injured by such construction or maintenance may sue, or in lieu of such
bond, a policy of liability insurance insuring the City and the licensee
against all loss, liability or damage which may result by reason of the

65.Editor's Note: See MacFarline v. O'Leary (1935) 245 A.D. 164, 281 N.Y.S. 112, affirmed
without opinion in 268 N.Y. 605, 198 N.E. 426, wherein the Court said: "Since Sections 1 to
20 (constituting Article 1) of the local law have been declared invalid (Bareham v. City of
Rochester, 246 N.Y. 140, 158 N.E. 51, 55), Sections 37 to 41 fail of means of execution.
The recall election cannot be 'held in accordance with the provisions of Article I of this
local law' (to use the language of Section 40) for the reason that Article I has been
annulled by the decision in the Bareham Case; and such election cannot be held in
accordance with the General Election Law, because such law makes no provision for
placing upon the ballot the name of any candidate not nominated by a political party or by
independent nomination. "Furthermore, we think that appellant takes too narrow a view
of what was decided in the Bareham Case. To be sure, the Court of Appeals, in its opinion,
speaks of Sections 1 to 20 of the local law as the sections particularly condemned, for
those are the sections that provide for the nomination and election of councilmen, but the
opinion, as well us the judgment following the Court of Appeals' decision, states 'the local
law to be invalid insofar as it supersedes the provisions of the Election Law,' etc., and does
not confine the decision of invalidity merely to Sections 1 to 20. Section 40 supersedes the
Election Law and likewise falls under the condemnation of the decision in the Bareham
Case."

A. No claim against the City shall be paid unless it is evidenced by a claim
voucher, approved by the head of the department for which the
obligation was incurred, or by such employee or employees in the
department as shall be designated by the department head by a rule or
written direction filed with the Director of Finance; and each such
officer and his or her surety shall be liable to the City for all loss or
damage sustained by the City by reason of his or her negligent or
corrupt approval of any claim voucher. For the purposes of this section,
the head of any bureau, division, office, commission, court or board
reporting directly to the Mayor shall be treated as a department head.
B. The Director of Accounting shall examine all payrolls, bills and other
claims and demands against the City and, except as otherwise provided
in the section, shall not pass any claim for payment unless he or she has
found that the claim is in proper form, correctly computed and duly
approved; that it is justly and legally due and payable; that an
appropriation or authorization has been made therefor which has a
sufficient balance; and that there is money in the treasury to make the
payment. He or she may investigate any claim and for that purpose may
summon before him or her any officer, agent or employee of city, the
claimant or other person and examine him or her upon oath or
affirmation relative thereto, which oath or affirmation he or she may
administer. If the Director of Accounting authorized payment of any
claim for which no appropriation or authorization has been made or for
which there is no sufficient balance in the proper appropriation or fund
or which is otherwise contrary to law or ordinance, he or she and his or
her sureties shall be individually liable to the City for the amount
thereof.

Council, by ordinance, authorizes the entering into of such obligation.
Such approval may be evidenced by the word "Approved" and the
signature of the Director of Finance or Deputy Director of Finance on
such contract, agreement, purchase, order or obligation or in other
appropriate manner. When the obligation is entered into or made with
such approval, the sum so approved shall be considered encumbered
until the City is discharged from the obligation. Any officer of the City
making or voting for any contract, agreement, purchase, order or other
obligation prohibited by this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
B. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection A of this section, in the
case of a public emergency arising out of an accident or other
unforeseen occurrence or condition whereby circumstances affecting
public buildings, public property or the life, health, safety or property of
the inhabitants of the City require immediate action which cannot await
approval as required by Subsection A of this section, but subject to the
provisions of § 6-16 of the Charter of the City of Rochester, entitled
"Expenditures in excess of appropriations prohibited," contracts,
agreements, purchases, orders or other obligations involving the
expenditure of money may be entered into by the appropriate officer,

Director of Finance, provided that the approval required by Subsection
A of this section shall be obtained as expeditiously as possible and in

depositories shall be verified by the Treasurer at least once in each month.
No money shall be drawn from such banks or trust companies except on
checks or drafts signed by the Treasurer, one of his or her deputies or one of
his or her employees duly designated in writing by him or her and approved
by the Council, countersigned by the Director of Finance. Such checks shall
be made payable to the person entitled to receive the same unless such
moneys are for public use in the Treasurer's office, in which case such
checks or drafts must be made payable to the order of the Treasurer. No

notification to impacted New York residents and nonresidents. The City
values the protection of private information of individuals. The City
shall notify an individual when there has been or is reasonably believed
to have been a compromise of the individual's private information in
compliance with the Information Security Breach and Notification Act
and this policy.
B. Definitions. When used in this section, the following words and phrases
shall have the following meanings:
BREACH OF THE SECURITY OF THE SYSTEM  Unauthorized
acquisition or acquisition without valid authorization of computerized
data which compromises the security, confidentiality, or integrity of
personal information maintained by the City. Good-faith acquisition
of personal information by an employee or agent of the City for the
purposes of the City is not a breach of the security of the system,
provided that the private information is not used or subject to
unauthorized disclosure. In determining whether information has been
acquired, or is reasonably believed to have been acquired, by an
83.Editor's Note: L.L. No. 8-1972 provided for this section, which was formerly § 6-16, to be
renumbered as § 6-27.
§ 6-26 CHARTER OF THE CITY OF ROCHESTER § 6-29
C:105
unauthorized person or a person without valid authorization, the City
may consider the following factors, among others:
CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY  Any person which, for monetary
fees, dues, or on a cooperative nonprofit basis, regularly engages in
whole or in part in the practice of assembling or evaluating consumer
credit information or other information on consumers for the purpose
of furnishing consumer reports to third parties, and which uses any
means or facility of interstate commerce for the purpose of preparing or
furnishing consumer reports. The City may request a list of consumer
reporting agencies from the State Attorney General when required to
make a notification under Subsection C of this section.
PRIVATE INFORMATION  Personal information in combination with
any one or more of the following data elements, when either the
personal information or the data element is not encrypted or encrypted
with an encryption key that has also been acquired: (1) social security
number; (2) driver's license number or nondriver identification card
number; or (3) account number, credit or debit card number, in
combination with any required security code, access code, or password
which would permit access to an individual's financial account. Private
information does not include publicly available information that is
lawfully made available to the general public from federal, state, or
local government records.
Indications that the information is in the physical possession and
control of an unauthorized person, such as a lost or stolen
computer or other device containing information; or
(1)
(2) Indications that the information has been downloaded or copied; or
Indications that the information was used by an unauthorized
person, such as fraudulent accounts opened or instances of identity
theft reported.
(3)
C. Where the City owns or licenses computerized data that includes
private information, the City shall disclose any breach of the security of
the system following discovery or notification of the breach in the
security of the system to any person whose private information was, or
is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by a person without valid
authorization. The disclosure shall be made in the most expedient time
possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with the legitimate
needs of law enforcement, as provided in Subsection E of this section,
or any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and
restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
D. Where the City maintains computerized data that includes private
information which the City does not own, the City shall notify the owner
or licensee of the information of any breach of the security of the
system immediately following discovery, if the private information was,
or is reasonably believed to have been, acquired by a person without
valid authorization.
§ 6-29 ROCHESTER CODE § 6-29
C:106
E. The notification required by this section may be delayed if a law
enforcement agency determines that such notification impedes a
criminal investigation. The notification required by this section shall be
made after such law enforcement agency determines that such
notification does not compromise such investigation.
F. The notice required by this section shall be directly provided to the
affected persons by one of the following methods:
(1) Written notice;
(2) Electronic notice, provided that the person to whom notice is
required has expressly consented to receiving said notice in
electronic form and a log of each such notification is kept by the
City; provided further, however, that in no case shall any person or
business require a person to consent to accepting said notice in
said form as a condition of establishing any business relationship or
engaging in any transaction;
(3) Telephone notification provided that a log of each such notification
is kept by the City; or
(4) Substitute notice, if the Director of Finance determines that the
cost of providing notice would exceed $250,000, or that the
affected class of subject persons to be notified exceeds 500,000, or
the City does not have sufficient contact information. Substitute
notice shall consist of all of the following:
(a) E-mail notice when the City has an e-mail address for the
subject persons;
(b) Conspicuous posting of the notice on the City's web site page;
and
(c) Notification to local media.
G. Regardless of the method by which notice is provided, such notice shall
include contact information for the City and a description of the
categories of information that were, or are reasonably believed to have
been, acquired by a person without valid authorization, including
specification of which of the elements of personal information and
private information were, or are reasonably believed to have been, so
acquired.
H. (1) In the event that any New York residents are to be notified, the City
shall notify the State Attorney General, the Consumer Protection
Board, and the State Office of Cyber Security and Critical
Infrastructure Coordination as to the timing, content and
distribution of the notices and approximate number of affected
persons. Such notice shall be made without delaying notice to
affected New York residents.
§ 6-29 CHARTER OF THE CITY OF ROCHESTER § 6-29
C:107
(2) In the event that more than 5,000 New York residents are to be
notified at one time, the City shall also notify consumer reporting
agencies as to the timing, content and distribution of the notices
and approximate number of affected persons. Such notice shall be
made without delaying notice to affected New York residents.

a certificate approved by the Mayor showing such emergency and the
necessity for such repairs.

28-1928; L.L. No. 6-1942; c. 710, L. 1943 (effective 4-2-1945)]
The local improvement fund is continued with the moneys contained
therein. There shall be placed to the credit of said fund the proceeds of the
sale of all bonds and notes issued for or on account of local improvements.
There shall also be placed to the credit of said fund all amounts received by
the City Treasurer from assessments and charges for local improvements,
including all interest collected thereon, which said amounts may be
appropriated to other purposes only by way of reimbursement to any other
fund including the general fund when indebtedness chargeable to such local
improvement fund has been paid from such other fund. There must be
paid therefrom all bonds and notes heretofore or hereafter issued for or on
account of local improvements and the interest thereon, except insofar as
provision may have been made for such payment from other sources, and all
costs and expenses of local improvements heretofore made and remaining
unpaid, or hereafter made. The local improvement fund shall not be used to
finance public improvements. All moneys due the local improvement fund
because of assessments against the City at large or against city-owned
property shall be paid into such fund within a year after the same shall
become due.
In addition to such local improvement fund as now existing, the Council may
by ordinance create one or more general or special local improvement funds
for the purpose of financing local improvements authorized subsequent to
January 1, 1928, including a fund to be used exclusively for the purpose
of paying so much of the cost and expense of such local improvements
as may be required by the ordinances assessing the same to be raised by
assessment upon local property or territory. If bonds and notes are issued
for or on account of such local improvements, their proceeds may be paid
into any such fund and such bonds and notes may be paid therefrom. Any
such ordinance may provide that amounts received or assessments and the

G. Penalties. Where the City Assessor applies to the Director of Finance
for the imposition of a penalty for alleged noncompliance with the
requirements of this section, the Director shall send a written notice of
proposed penalty to the property owner, stating that a penalty is being
requested by the Assessor, the amount of penalty requested and that a
hearing may be had before the Director of Finance or his or her
designee, provided that a request for a hearing is made on or before a

§ 6-75. Effect of assessment. [§ 197, c. 755, L. 1907]
The assessment against any lot or parcel of land may be made in the name
of the owner or occupant thereof, or by any description by which it may
be distinguished without reference to the owner or occupant thereof; and
an assessment is not invalid as against the real estate by reason of the
omission of the name of the owner or occupant thereof, or both, or because
of any error in the name of the person or corporation assessed therefor.
Every assessment creates a debt and personal obligation in favor of the
City and against the person or corporation assessed, provided that at the
time of the making of the assessment roll preparatory to hearing allegations
thereon the person or corporation assessed is a resident of the State of
New York and the owner or occupant of the lot or parcel of land assessed,
for the collection of which, together with interest, costs and expenses, said
City may maintain in its own name an action in any court of competent
jurisdiction, in addition to any other remedies now provided by law for the
collection thereof, and such action may be maintained even though said
assessment has been added to the annual City tax.
§ 6-76. All lands liable to local assessment except cemeteries.
[§ 192, c. 755, L. 1907; L.L. No. 9-1948]
All lots and parcels of land in the City of Rochester, even though exempt
from taxation under the general laws of the state, are liable to assessment
for public improvements and work,93 except lands actually used and
occupied for cemetery purposes and lots and plats therein, heretofore or
hereafter conveyed as places for the burial of the dead.
to raise any factual issues regarding his or her alleged failure to comply
with the requirements of this section. After the hearing, if a hearing
is requested, or after the date by which a hearing must have been
requested, if no request is made, the Director of Finance shall issue
and send to the property owner a determination of penalty. Any penalty
shall be at the rate of 1% of the assessed value of the property for
which the information was requested, for each year of noncompliance,
beginning 30 days after service of the second notice to provide
information. The determination of penalty may provide for the accrual
of additional monthly penalties in the future, if the property owner
continues not to provide the requested information. Any penalties that
remain unpaid on May 15 may be added to the upcoming year's City
and school tax bill for the property for which information was requested
and shall thenceforth accrue interest and be a lien upon the property
as provided by law for other charges added to taxes. The notice of
proposed penalty and determination of penalty shall be sent to the
property owner by regular mail.

and superior to all other liens and encumbrances. In case an annual tax or
local assessment is levied upon a parcel of land and two or more persons
are or become the owners thereof, or it is situate in more than one district,
the Council may apportion such tax or assessment upon such parcel of land
in such manner as the Assessors may certify to be just, and thereupon such
tax or assessment becomes separate liens upon the respective parts of such
parcel of land and in the respective amounts designated by the Council.

heard at a time specified in such notice, to correct any such tax or local
assessment, or any part thereof, and to reassess the same in such amount
as it deems proper, including therein interest at such rate on such amount
as it deems proper, against the proper person or corporation or property it

Assessor, except where the fixing of valuation is by law or this Charter
otherwise provided. It is not necessary for nonresidents to be
designated therein as such or nonresident property to be placed in
separate parts of the tentative annual assessment rolls. Real estate may
be assessed and taxed in the name of the owner or occupant thereof or
by any description by which it may be distinguished without reference
to the owner or occupant thereof; and an assessment or a tax thereon is
not invalid as against the real estate by reason of the omission of the
name of the owner or occupant thereof, or both, or because of any error
in the name of the person or corporation assessed or taxed therefor.
When the tentative annual assessment rolls are completed, an oath
substantially in the following form must be written or printed upon and
attached to the tentative annual assessment rolls and each of them
signed by the Assessor and sworn to before an officer authorized to
administer oaths, namely, "I, the undersigned, do depose and swear
that I have set down in the foregoing tentative annual assessment roll
all the real estate situated in the __________ District, according to my
best information; and that except where the value of any special
franchise has been fixed by the State Tax Commission and except where
the fixing of valuation is by law or this Charter otherwise provided. I
have estimated the value of said real estate at the sums which I have
decided to be the full value thereof." [§ 188, c. 755, L. 1907; L.L. No.

it is situate or otherwise taxable by law.
C. The Assessor may in his or her discretion place the assessments of
special franchises for all the districts of the City in one book, and may in
his or her discretion place the assessments of real property used for
railroad purposes or any part thereof for all the districts of the City in
one book; and may in his or her discretion place the assessments of real
property used for telegraph and telephone purposes, or any part
thereof, for all the districts of the City in one book. The descriptions of

the annual assessment rolls shall be delivered to the Director of Finance.
The Director of Finance shall, after the Council has levied the annual tax,
cause the same to be inserted in the said assessment rolls in columns
opposite the valuations therein set forth. Said rolls shall thereupon become
and constitute the tax rolls of the City of Rochester for the next ensuing

taxed is a resident of the State of New York and, in case of a tax upon
real estate, the owner or occupant thereof. To each of the tax rolls there
must be annexed a warrant under the hand of the Mayor and the Seal of

30 against any assessment, penalty, charge or fee which is added to
taxes.
B. The Director of Finance shall submit to the City Council any delinquent
assessments, penalties, charges or fees and any other amounts to be

the Council by the Mayor. The Council shall, after a public hearing and
after making any amendments or corrections to any of said amounts as
it may deem proper, confirm said amounts no later than the date the
annual budget is adopted by the Council. When said amounts are
confirmed, they shall be inserted in the annual tax rolls and shall
become a part of the annual tax upon the respective parcels against
which such amounts are charged and shall be subject to all the

be specified by the Director of Finance of the City of Rochester. Every
return shall have annexed thereto an affidavit of the head of the utility
making the same, or of the owner or of a co-partner thereof, or of a
principal officer of the corporation, if such business be conducted by
a corporation, to the effect that the statements contained therein are
true.
E. At the time of filing a return as required by this section, each utility
shall pay to the Director of Finance of the City of Rochester the tax
imposed by this section for the period covered by such return. Such tax
shall be due and payable at the time of filing the return or, if a return is
not filed when due, on the last day on which the return is required to be
filed.
F. In case any return filed pursuant to this section shall be insufficient or
unsatisfactory to the Director of Finance of the City of Rochester, and if
a corrected or sufficient return is not filed within 20 days after the same
is required by notice from the Director of Finance of the City of
Rochester, or if no return is made for any period, the Director of
Finance of the City of Rochester shall determine the amount of tax due
from such information as the Director of Finance is able to obtain and, if
necessary, may estimate the tax on the basis of external indices or
otherwise. The Director of Finance of the City of Rochester shall give
notice of such determination to the person liable for such tax. Such
determination shall finally and irrevocably fix such tax, unless the
person against whom it was assessed shall, within 30 days after the
giving of notice of such determination, apply to the Director of Finance
of the City of Rochester for a hearing, or unless the Director of Finance
of the City of Rochester, of his or her own motion, shall reduce the
same. After such hearing, the Director of Finance of the City of
Rochester shall give notice of a final decision to the person liable for the
tax. The decision of the Director of Finance of the City of Rochester may
be reviewed by a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law
and Rules of the State of New York, if application therefor is made
within 30 days after giving of notice of such decision. An order to
review such decision shall not be granted unless the amount of any tax
sought to be reviewed, with interest and penalties thereon, if any, shall
be first deposited with the Director of Finance of the City of Rochester
and an undertaking filed with said Director, in such amount and with
§ 6-140 CHARTER OF THE CITY OF ROCHESTER § 6-140
C:145
such sureties as a justice of the Supreme Court shall approve, to
the effect that, if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed,
the applicant will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the
prosecution of such proceeding, or, at the option of the applicant,
such undertaking may be in a sum sufficient to cover the tax, interest,
penalties, costs and charges aforesaid, in which event the applicant
shall not be required to pay such tax, interest and penalties as a
condition precedent to the granting of such order.
G. Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this section
may be given by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended,
in a postpaid envelope, addressed to such person at the address given
by such person in the last return filed by such person under this section
or, if no return has been filed, then to such address as may be
obtainable. The mailing of such notice shall be presumptive evidence of
the receipt of the same by the person to whom addressed. Any period of
time, which is determined according to the provisions of this section by
the giving of notice, shall commence to run from the date of mailing of
such notice.
H. Any person failing to file a return or corrected return, or to pay any tax
or any portion thereof, within the time required by this section shall be
subject to a penalty of 5% of the amount of tax due, plus 1% of such tax
for each month of delay or fraction thereof, excepting the first month,
after such return was required to be filed or such tax became due; but
the Director of Finance of the City of Rochester, if satisfied that the
delay was excusable, may remit all or any portion of such penalty.
I. If, within one year from the payment of any tax or penalty, the payer
thereof shall make application for a refund thereof and the Director of
Finance of the City of Rochester or the court shall determine that such
tax or penalty or any portion thereof was erroneously or illegally
collected, the Director of Finance of the City of Rochester shall refund
the amount so determined. For like cause and within the same period, a
refund may be so made on the initiative of the Director of Finance of the
City of Rochester. However, no refund shall be made of a tax or penalty
paid pursuant to a determination of the Director of Finance of the City
of Rochester as hereinbefore provided unless the Director of Finance of
the City of Rochester, after a hearing as hereinbefore provided, or of his
or her own motion, shall have reduced the tax or penalty or it shall have
been established in a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice
Law and Rules of the State of New York that such determination was
erroneous or illegal. All refunds shall be made out of moneys collected
under this section. An application for a refund, made as hereinbefore
provided, shall be deemed an application for the revision of any tax or
penalty complained of, and the Director of Finance of the City of
Rochester may receive additional evidence with respect thereto. After
making this determination, the Director of Finance of the City of
Rochester shall give notice thereof to the person interested, and such
person shall be entitled to an order to review such determination under
§ 6-140 ROCHESTER CODE § 6-140
C:146
said Article 78, subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained
relating to the granting of such an order.
Where any tax imposed hereunder shall have been erroneously,
illegally or unconstitutionally collected and application for the refund
thereof duly made to the Director of Finance and such officer shall
have made a determination denying such refund, such determination
shall be reviewable by a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil
Practice Law and Rules; provided, however, that such proceeding is
instituted within 30 days after the giving of the notice of such denial,
that a final determination of tax due was not previously made and that
an undertaking is filed with the Director of Finance in such amount
and with such sureties as a justice of the Supreme Court shall approve
to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax refunded,
the petitioner will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the
prosecution of such proceeding.
J. The tax imposed by this section shall be charged against and be paid by
the utility and shall not be added as a separate item to bills rendered by
the utility to customers or others but shall constitute a part of the
operating costs of such utility.
K. Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty imposed by this
section, the Corporation Counsel shall, upon the request of the Director
of Finance of the City of Rochester, bring an action to enforce payment
of the same. The proceeds of any judgment obtained in any such action
shall be paid to the Director of Finance of the City of Rochester. Each
such tax and penalty shall be a lien upon the property of the person
liable to pay the same, in the same manner and to the same extent that
the tax and penalty imposed by § 186-b of the Tax Law is made a lien.
L. In the administration of this section, the Director of Finance of the City
of Rochester shall have the power to make such reasonable rules and
regulations, not inconsistent with law, as may be necessary for the
exercise of such powers and the performance of such duties and to
prescribe the form of blanks, reports and other records relating to the
administration and enforcement of the tax, to take testimony and
proofs, under oath, with reference to any matter within the line of such
official duty under this section, and to subpoena and require the
attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers and
documents.
M. Except in accordance with the proper judicial order or as otherwise
provided by law, it shall be unlawful for the Director of Finance of the
City of Rochester, or any agent, clerk or employee of the City of
Rochester, to divulge or make known in any manner the amount of
gross income or gross operating income or any particulars set forth or
disclosed in any return under this section. The officer charged with the
custody of such returns shall not be required to produce any of them or
evidence of anything contained in them in any action or proceeding in
any court, except on behalf of the City of Rochester in an action or
§ 6-140 CHARTER OF THE CITY OF ROCHESTER § 6-140
C:147
proceeding under the provisions of this section, or on behalf of the
State Tax Commission in an action or proceeding under the provisions
of the Tax Law of the State of New York, or on behalf of any party
to any action or proceeding under the provisions of this section when
the returns or facts shown thereby are directly involved in such action
or proceeding, in either of which events the court may require the
production of, and may admit in evidence, so much of said returns or
of the facts shown thereby as are pertinent to the action or proceeding
and no more.
Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a person,
or such person's duly authorized representative, of a copy of any
return filed by such person, nor to prohibit the publication of statistics
so classified as to prevent the identification of particular returns and
the items thereof, or the publication of delinquent lists showing the
names of the persons who have failed to pay their taxes at the time
and in the manner provided for by this section, together with any
relevant information which, in the opinion of the Director of Finance
of the City of Rochester, may assist in the collection of such delinquent
taxes; or the inspection by the Corporation Counsel or other legal
representatives of the City of Rochester of the return of any person
who shall bring action to set aside or review the tax based thereon,
or against whom an action has been instituted in accordance with the
provisions of this section.
Any offense against the foregoing secrecy provisions shall be
punishable by a fine not exceeding $1,000 or by imprisonment not
exceeding six months, or both, and if the offender be an officer, agent,
clerk or employee of the City of Rochester, he or she shall be dismissed
from office and shall be incapable of holding any office or employment
in the City of Rochester for a period of five years thereafter.
Notwithstanding any provisions of this section, the Director of Finance
of the City of Rochester may exchange with the chief fiscal officer
of any other City in the State of New York information contained in
returns filed under this section, provided such other City grants similar
privileges to the City of Rochester and provided such information is to
be used for tax purposes only, and the Director of Finance of the City of
Rochester shall, upon request, furnish the State Tax Commission with
any information contained in such returns.
N. All taxes and penalties received by the Director of Finance of the City of
Rochester for taxes heretofore or hereafter imposed under this section
shall be credited and deposited by said Director in the general fund of
the City.

PART E
Community Choice Aggregation Energy Program
§ 7-50. Legislative findings; intent and purpose; authority. [§ 1, L.L.
No. 6-2019]
§ 7-51. Definitions.
For purposes of this Part, and unless otherwise expressly stated or unless
the context otherwise requires, the terms in this Part shall have the
meanings employed in the State of New York Public Service Commission's
Uniform Business Practices or, if not so defined there, as indicated below:
A. It is the policy of both the City of Rochester and the State of New York
to reduce costs and provide cost certainty for the purpose of economic
development, to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy
resources such as wind and solar, and wider deployment of distributed
energy resources as well as to examine the retail energy markets and
increase participation of and benefits for eligible consumers in those
markets. One of the ways to advance those policies in New York is
Community Choice Aggregation ("CCA"), which allows local
governments to determine the default supplier of electricity on behalf
of eligible consumers.
B. The purpose of CCA is to allow participating local governments to
procure energy supply service for eligible consumers, who will have the
opportunity to opt out of the procurement, while maintaining
transmission and distribution service from the existing distribution
utility. This Part establishes a program (the "CCA Program") that will
allow the City and other local governments to work together through a
shared purchasing model to put out for bid the total amount of
electricity being purchased by eligible consumers within the
jurisdictional boundaries of participating municipalities. Eligible
consumers will have the opportunity to have more control to lower their
overall energy costs, to spur clean energy innovation and investment, to
improve customer choice and value, and to protect the environment;
thereby, fulfilling the purposes of this Part and fulfilling an important
public purpose.
C. The City is authorized to implement this CCA Program pursuant to
§ 10(1)(ii)(a)(12) of the New York Municipal Home Rule Law; and State
of New York Public Service Commission Case No. 14-M-0224,
Proceeding on Motion of the Commission to Enable Community Choice
Aggregation Programs (issued April 21, 2016) as may be amended,
including subsequent orders of the Public Service Commission (PSC)
issued in connection with or related to Case No. 14-M-0224, to the
extent that orders related to Case No. 14-M-0224 enable actions by the
City.
D. This Part shall be known and may be cited as the "Community Choice
Aggregation Energy Program Law of the City of Rochester."

for CCA customers.
D. The operation and ownership of the utility service shall remain with the
distribution utility. The City's participation in a CCA Program
constitutes neither the purchase of a public utility system, nor the
furnishing of utility service. The City shall not take over any part of the
electric transmission or distribution system and will not furnish any

Program will interfere with a choice the customer has already made to
take service pursuant to a special rate. Those consumers may be
enrolled on an opt-in basis.
C. New consumers shall be enrolled on an opt-out basis.
A. An opt-out letter, printed on municipal letterhead, shall be mailed to
eligible consumers at least 30 days prior to customer enrollment. The

and that information on those consumers, including energy usage data
and APP status, will be provided to the ESCO.
B. All consumers shall have the option to opt out of the CCA Program at
any time without penalty.
§ 7-52 ROCHESTER CODE § 7-54
C:178

utility information; (ii) the utility's internal requirements and
procedures relating to the protection of information that identifies or
can be used to identify an individual that apply with respect to the City

utility for the purpose of protecting customer data.
A. Annual reports shall be filed with the City Council by March 31 of each
year and cover the previous calendar year.

served; number of consumers cancelling during the year; number of
complaints received; commodity prices paid; value-added services
provided during the year (e.g., installation of DER or other clean energy
services); and administrative costs collected. The first report shall also
include the number of consumers who opted out in response to the
initial opt-out letter or letters.

or other treatment or for making inspections, and the City shall not be

pursuant to § 363 of the Retirement and Social Security Law, a
retirement for disability incurred in performance of duty allowance
pursuant to § 363-c of the Retirement and Social Security Law or

therefor may be made by the Chief of Police. If such application is
denied, the Chief of Police may appeal such determination.
D. If such police officer is not eligible for or is not granted such accidental
disability retirement allowance or retirement for disability incurred in
the performance of duty allowance or similar accidental disability
pension and is, nevertheless, in the opinion of the Police Physician,
unable to perform his or her regular duties as a result of such injury or
sickness but is able, in the opinion of the Police Physician, to perform
specified types of light police duty, payment of the full amount of

the damages as provided herein in relation to the condemnation of lands;
and in case he or she fails to do so, any person who has duly filed a claim
for damages which has not been adjusted may, after the expiration of three
months from the filing of the claim, make such application, upon notice
to the Corporation Counsel, and thereupon all the pertinent provisions of
this act relating to condemnation proceedings apply to such proceeding. All

no execution may issue against the City or against any department, board,
bureau or officer thereof on a judgment payable by the City, unless the
amount of such judgment has not been included in the tax levy; provided,

A. Declaration of legislative findings. The Council finds that public
nuisances exist in the City of Rochester in the operation of certain
establishments and the use of property in flagrant violation of certain
Penal Law and Municipal Code provisions, which nuisances
substantially and seriously interfere with the interest of the public in
the quality of life and total community environment, commerce in the
City, property values and the public health, safety and welfare. The
Council further finds that the continued occurrence of such activities
and violations is detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the
people of the City of Rochester and of the businesses thereof and the
§ 10-11 CHARTER OF THE CITY OF ROCHESTER § 10-12

visitors thereto. It is the purpose of the Council to establish a means
to remedy these public nuisances, which shall be in addition to the use
of procedures and remedies available under other laws. The Council
further finds that the remedies that may be implemented pursuant to
this law are reasonable and necessary in order to protect the health
and safety of the people of the City and to promote the general welfare.
The Council finds that it is the public policy of the City of Rochester
to ensure that, in an emergency, all crime victims, including victims of
domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, or sexual abuse, are able
to contact police or emergency assistance without penalty under this
ordinance. The Council further finds that this law is not intended to
sanction, penalize or displace victims of triggering enumerated crimes
or violations that are deemed public nuisances pursuant to this City
Charter section; accordingly points, sanctions and penalties assessed
hereunder shall not be applied against the premises where an owner,

C:250
occupational licenses, and/or the suspension or revocation

violation for which it is demonstrated that an owner, lessor,
lessee, mortgagee or any other person in possession or
having charge of as agent or otherwise, or having any
interest in the property, real or personal was a victim,
including a victim of domestic violence, dating violence,
stalking, or sexual abuse.
(b) Service of notice. The Notice of Hearing, along with a copy of
the text of this section, shall be served upon the owner, lessee
and mortgagee at least 30 calendar days before the scheduled
hearing, in the following manner:

Article 3 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules or by means of
first-class mail with delivery confirmation sent to the
owner's address as it is maintained on record with the City
Treasurer pursuant to City Charter §§ 6-118 and 6-119. If

(d) Hearing procedure.
i. The hearing shall be conducted by an independent hearing

parties may present evidence and call witnesses on their
§ 10-12 CHARTER OF THE CITY OF ROCHESTER § 10-12
C:251
behalf, and may cross-examine any witnesses that testify
for the City. The rules of evidence prevailing in a court
of record shall not be controlling in abatement hearings.
The Mayor and/or the Corporation Counsel are authorized

be served on all parties along with the Notice of Hearing.
ii. For purposes of this section, a conviction by a court of
competent jurisdiction or an administrative bureau of the
violation or crime that gives rise to the assessment of
nuisance points shall not be required. Instead, to assess
the points, the City shall be required to prove by a
preponderance of the evidence that each element of the
charged offense has occurred. However, a conviction as
defined and applied in accordance with the provisions of
§ 1.20 of the Criminal Procedure Law, in any court of
competent jurisdiction, or a conviction or plea of guilty in
the Municipal Code Violations Bureau, shall constitute
conclusive proof of a point-assessable crime or violation
under this section.
iii. Defense of innocence. An innocent party's interest in
property shall not be forfeited. The party claiming
innocence shall have the burden of proving innocence by a
preponderance of the evidence. Such innocence may be
demonstrated by proof that the party (i) did not know of
the conduct giving rise to nuisance; or (ii) upon learning of
the conduct giving rise to the nuisance, did all that
reasonably could be expected under the circumstances to
terminate such use of the property. For the purposes of
this subsection, ways in which a person may show that he
or she did all that reasonably could be expected may
include demonstrating that such person, to the extent
permitted by law, (a) gave timely notice to an appropriate
law enforcement agency of information that led the person
to know that nuisance activity was occurring or would
occur, and (b) in a timely fashion revoked or made a good
faith attempt to revoke permission for those engaging in
such nuisance activity to use the property. However, a
person shall not be required by this subparagraph to take
steps that the person reasonably believes would be likely
to subject any person to physical danger. Even where a
party with an interest in the property establishes his or her
innocence in accordance with this subsection, still the City
may impose any reasonable and legally permissible
remedy to abate the nuisance so long as it does not
infringe upon the innocent party's interest in the property.

C:252
iv. Defense of victims. In accordance with the public policy
and findings calling for the protection of victims of crimes
and violations in Subsection A of this section, a party shall
be entitled to testify or present other evidence in support
of a claim that nuisance points should not be assessed for a
specified violation or crime wherein an owner, lessor,
lessee, mortgagee or any other person in possession or
having charge of as agent or otherwise, or having any
interest in the property, real or personal was a victim of
the enumerated violation or crime that triggered the
assessment of nuisance points. The party claiming the
victim defense shall have the burden of proving its factual
elements by a preponderance of the evidence in order to
be entitled to the removal of assessed nuisance points.
(e) Hearing officer report and recommendation. Within 14
business days [as defined above in Subsection C(1)(a)(i)] after
the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall render a
written report and recommendation to the Commissioner of
Neighborhood and Business Development, which shall set
forth factual findings based upon evidence in the record and
shall state whether a public nuisance was proven by a
preponderance of the evidence. In the event that a public
nuisance is so proven, the hearing officer shall also render a
written recommendation as to the remedy to be imposed to
abate the public nuisance. The hearing officer's written
recommendation shall be served upon all interested parties in
the same manner as the original Notice of Hearing.
(f) Final determination. Within seven business days [as defined
above in Subsection C(1)(a)(i)] days after receipt of the hearing
officer's report and recommendation, the Commissioner of
Neighborhood and Business Development shall issue a final
determination either accepting, modifying, or rejecting the
hearing officer's report and recommendation. If the
Commissioner determines that there is a public nuisance,
based on either the recommendation of the hearing officer or
the Commissioner's own assessment of the hearing record, the
final determination shall articulate the remedy to be imposed
and set forth a reasonable manner in which the remedy elected
is expected to abate the public nuisance. No remedy shall be
imposed that goes beyond the remedy or remedies previously
specified in the Notice of Hearing. The final determination
shall be served on all interested parties in the same manner as
the Notice of Hearing. A copy of the final determination shall
also be posted at the building, erection or place where a public
nuisance exists or is occurring in violation of law.
(g) Closure. Where the final determination orders the closure of a
building, erection or place, the closure shall become effective
§ 10-12 CHARTER OF THE CITY OF ROCHESTER § 10-12
C:253
30 calendar days after the posting of the final determination
upon the building, erection or place, and may after that time
be enforced by the Rochester Police Department. The effective
date shall be specified in the final determination.
i. In no event shall any closing ordered under this section be
for a period of more than one year from the issuance of the
Commissioner's final determination.
ii. A closing directed by the Commissioner pursuant to this
section shall not be deemed to constitute an act of
possession, ownership or control by the City of the closed
premises.
iii. It shall be a violation of this section for any person to
permit any other person to use or occupy any building,
erection or place, or portion thereof, ordered closed by the
Commissioner. Such a violation or mutilation or removal of
a posted order of the Commissioner designee shall be
punishable by a fine of not more than $250 or by
imprisonment not exceeding 15 calendar days, or both,
provided such posted order contains therein a notice of
such penalty.
G. Additional provisions.
(1) The Mayor, Commissioner of Neighborhood and Business
Development ("Commissioner") or NSC Director may promulgate
rules, regulations, policies and procedures to carry out and give full
effect to the provisions of this section. Any such rules, regulations,
policies and procedures shall be filed with the City Clerk.
(2) The Commissioner or NSC Director shall implement a training
program for NSC employees involved in the enforcement of this
section and for other City employees as needed.
(3) If any provision of this section or the application thereof to any
person or circumstances is held invalid, the remainder of this
section and the application of such provisions to other persons and
circumstances shall not be rendered invalid thereby.
(4) The Commissioner shall prepare quarterly reports to be submitted
to City Council summarizing the actions taken under this section

§ 11-1. City Electric Agency.
A. Pursuant to Article 14-A of the General Municipal Law and other laws
applicable thereto, a City Electric Agency ("Agency") is hereby
established for the purpose of operating a public utility electric service
within the City's territorial limits to furnish to itself or, for
compensation, to its inhabitants any electric service similar to that
furnished by any public utility company specified in Article 4 of the
Public Service Law and also for the purpose of acquiring hydroelectric
power from the Power Authority of the State of New York ("PASNY").
B. The method of acquiring and operating the necessary elements of such
electric service shall be as follows:
(1) The Agency shall acquire hydroelectric power from PASNY for
delivery to the local private utility company service area in the City;
and
(2) The Agency shall agree with the local private utility company for
the local private utility company to use or lease its distribution,
substation and transmission facilities necessary to deliver PASNY
hydroelectric power acquired by the Agency to electric customers
in the local private utility company service area in the City.
C. The method of furnishing such electric service shall consist of acquiring
PASNY hydroelectric power; delivering said power to the local private
utility company over the transmission and distribution facilities of
PASNY and such other entities at transmission or distribution voltages
as may be required to ensure proper power availability to the local
private utility company; and delivering said power over the local private
utility company's transmission, substation and distribution facilities, for
compensation, to electric customers in the local private utility company
service area within the City. The local private utility company may, by
agreement with the Agency, deliver said power and collect and remit to
the Agency the charges therefor.
D. All agreements entered into in furtherance of acquisition and operation
of the Agency's service shall first be approved by the City Council.
Rates for the sale of PASNY hydroelectric power by the Agency shall be
established by the City Council and shall be sufficient to permit the
Agency to recover its costs of doing business, but shall not provide any
profit or return on investment to the Agency. Any reduction in utility
gross receipts tax revenues received by the City as a result of the
implementation of this section may be paid by the Agency as an in-lieu-

§ 11-2. Amendments.
Any material amendment of this article, including any attempt by the City or
the Agency to exercise the power of condemnation of the local private utility
company's generation, distribution and transmission system, or to establish
transmission or distribution facilities separate from the local private utility
company for the purpose of this article, shall not be effective unless
approved by the voters at a referendum as required by Article 14-A of the
General Municipal Law.
of tax payment to the City. Any reduction in property tax revenues
received by the City from the local private utility company as a result
of the implementation of this section shall be paid by the local private
utility company as an in-lieu-of tax payment to the City. Except as
otherwise required by PASNY pursuant to applicable law, and to the
maximum extent practicable, the PASNY hydroelectric power acquired
by the Agency shall be furnished first to fulfill the electric energy
requirements of City residential consumers and then may be furnished
to fulfill the electric energy requirements of the City and other
municipal corporations and to fulfill the electric energy requirements
of all other classes of electric customers, including commercial and
industrial customers. Nothing contained in this section provides or is
intended to provide or shall be construed or interpreted as providing
that the furnishing of PASNY hydroelectric power by the Agency to
purchasers who are also electric customers of the local private utility
company shall diminish the geographic boundaries of the local private
utility company's service area, or the legal status of said purchasers as
customers of the local private utility company.
E. The method of acquiring and operating the electric service described in
this section contemplates neither the exercise of any power of
condemnation by the City or the Agency of the local private utility
company generation, distribution and transmission system, nor the
establishment by the City or the Agency of transmission or distribution
facilities separate from the local private utility company. However,
nothing in this section prohibits the City from acquiring, constructing
or owning facilities for lighting its streets.

otherwise provided in the ordinance authorizing, the improvement.
F. Curb. The assessed cost of curb construction or curb resetting, when
constructed or reset generally along the street, or portions thereof,
improved, shall be distributed on the various lots within the district of
assessment in proportion to their respective equalized frontages with
allowances for curb omitted and for charges for additional curb
required or driveways as follows:
(1) Each lot shall be charged for the cost of curb constructed for a
distance equal to its equalized frontage less the straight curb
omitted because of driveways in the course of the lot frontage plus

§ 3-3 ROCHESTER CODE § 3-4
3:442
§ 3-4. Average depth.
The average of a regular lot with sides perpendicular to the street line and
with a straight rear lot line is the sum of the two sides divided by two. The
average depth of other lots shall be determined as follows:
§ 3-5. Equalized frontage.
In this section, lots are classified according to whether the frontage is on
one street, two streets, three or more streets. The term "street" as used in
this section means a highway 25 feet or over in width and the term "alley"
means a highway less than 25 feet in width. An alley is not to be considered
as a street in following the above mentioned classification. If a lot fronts on
a street, an alley or on both a street or an alley, the equalized frontage on
either the street or the alley is to be computed according to the rules given
for lots fronting on one street only. If a lot fronts on two or more streets and
an alley, the alley is to be disregarded in computing the equalized frontages
on the streets and the equalized frontage on the alley is to be computed
as for a lot fronting on one street only. Portions of lots to a depth of 250
feet only are to be considered. If a lot exceeds this depth and is irregular,
draw a line 250 feet from the street line, parallel thereto, and consider this
line as the rear of the lot in computing its equalized frontage. In computing
equalized frontages, appropriate depth factors shall be selected from the
tables of depth factors hereinafter set forth. Curved lines in lot boundaries
shall be approximated by straight lines enclosing approximately the same
area as the actual lot boundaries. The equalized frontages of lots or portions
thereof of the following descriptions shall be computed, respectively, as
follows:
A. Drop perpendiculars from the extremities of the rear lot line to the
street line. If the rear lot line is a straight line, the average depth of
such lot is the sum of the lengths of such two perpendiculars divided by
two. If the rear lot line is not straight, compute the area of the figure
bounded by the rear lot line, the perpendiculars and the street line and
divide such total area by the distance between the perpendiculars
measured alone, the street line and the quotient will be the average
depth of the lot.
A. Lots fronting on one street only.
(1) Regular lot. Multiply the actual frontage by the depth factor for the
average depth of the lot as given in the table of depth factors for
regular lots.
(2) Triangular lot with base at street line. Multiply the actual frontage
by the depth factor for the depth of the triangle as given in the
table of depth factors for triangular lots, base at street line.
(3) Triangular lot with apex at street line. Multiply the base (the side
opposite the apex) by the depth factor for the average depth of the
lot as given in the table of depth factors for triangular lots, apex at
§ 3-4 ASSESSMENT METHOD, LOCAL § 3-5
3:443
street line. If the base is not parallel to the street line, project it on
the street line by drawing lines perpendicular to the street line and
use this projected distance instead of the base to multiply by the
depth factor for the average depth of the lot as given in the table of
depth factors for triangular lots, apex at street line.
(4) Lot removed from street line. If a lot (other than a triangle with
apex at street line) is so removed from the street line that it has no
side fronting thereon, connect it to the street line by straight lines
drawn at right angles to the street line, forming a figure enclosing
the lot and an additional area. Compute the equalized frontage of
the figure so formed and, separately compute the equalized
frontage of the additional area by the rules given in this section.
The difference between such equalized frontages will be the
equalized frontage for the lot.
(5) Irregular lot. Divide such a lot by straight lines drawn at right
angles to the street line, into portions conforming to one or more of
the following descriptions. Compute the equalized frontage of each
portion by the foregoing rules. The sum of such equalized frontages
is the equalized frontage for the whole lot.
B. Lots fronting on two streets only.
(1) Corner lots and unequal frontages. If the actual frontages of a
corner lot are unequal to the extent that the shorter frontage is
60% or less of the larger frontage, the equalized frontage on each
street shall be computed as follows:
(a) On the street with the shorter actual frontage. Draw a line
parallel to the street line and 100 feet distant therefrom
including the lot or a portion thereof. Compute the equalized
frontage as for a lot fronting on one street only (according to
the rules contained in earlier subsections of this section) using
only the lot or portion thereof included between the street line
and said line so drawn.
(b) On the street with the longer actual frontage. Draw a line
parallel to the street line and 100 feet distant therefrom
including the lot or portion thereof. Compute the equalized
frontage as far a lot fronting on one street only using only the
lot or portion thereof included between the street line and said
line so drawn. Subtract the actual frontage of the lot on the
other street (the shorter actual frontage) or 50 feet, whichever
is the lesser.
(2) Corner lots with frontages equal or approximately equal. If the
actual frontages of a corner lot are equal or approximately equal so
that the shorter frontage is more than 60% of the longer, then the
equalized frontage on each street is computed as follows:
§ 3-5 ROCHESTER CODE § 3-5
3:444
(a) Draw a line bisecting the angle between the two streets,
dividing the lot into two portions. Compute the equalized
frontage on either street as for a lot fronting on one street only,
using only the portion of the lot (as divided by aforesaid angle
bisecting line) adjacent to such street.
(3) Through lots. Divide such a lot into two portions by a line drawn
equidistant from the two street frontages. The equalized frontage
on either street is to be computed by the foregoing rules for lots
fronting one street only, using only the portion of the lot (as divided
by the aforesaid equidistant line) which is adjacent to such street.
C. Lots fronting on three or more streets.
(1) Draw lines bisecting each angle formed by streets intersecting at a
corner of such a lot. Terminate each angle bisecting line at its
intersection with another such line. Draw lines equidistant from
each pair of opposite, nonadjacent street frontages. Terminate each
equidistant line at its intersection with an angle bisecting line. With
the lot divided in portions by aforesaid lines compute the equalized
frontage on any street as for a lot fronting on one street only, using
only the portions of the lot adjacent to such street.
(2) The following tables are the tables of depth factors to be used as

renewal process or fails to comply substantially with any material provision
of this chapter or the franchise agreement or any reasonable order,
direction or permit that is properly issued by the City. The City shall
not have the right to revoke a franchise if a material misrepresentation
or breach occurs without any fault of a franchisee or occurs as a result

hardship or by the misfeasance or malfeasance of a franchisee's directors,

accordance with the following procedures:
the procedural requirements of this section, the franchisee may seek
review of such final decision within 120 days of the date of the issuance
of the decision either in Federal District Court for the Western District
of New York or in Supreme Court in Monroe County. The Court shall
grant appropriate relief if it finds that any action of the City is not in
substantial compliance with the procedural requirements of this section
or that the denial of the renewal proposal by the City is not supported
by substantial evidence based on the record of the proceeding
conducted under this section.
F. Any decision of the City on a proposal for renewal shall not be
considered final unless all administrative review by the State of New
York has occurred or the opportunity therefor has lapsed.
G. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, a franchisee may submit
a proposal for the renewal of a franchise at any time, and the City may,
after affording the public adequate notice and opportunity for
comment, grant or deny such proposal at any time, including after
proceedings pursuant to this section have commenced. The provisions
of this § 4A-6A through F shall not apply to a decision to grant or deny a
proposal under this subsection. The denial of a proposal for renewal
pursuant to this subsection shall not affect action on a renewal proposal
that is submitted in accordance with Subsections A through F of this
section.

misrepresentation or failure of compliance, setting forth the reasons
why he or she believes that the misrepresentation or failure is material
and substantial. The franchisee shall have 30 days subsequent to
receipt of the notice to address the misrepresentation or correct the
failure and respond to the Mayor, unless the time is extended by the
Mayor for good cause shown by the franchisee. [Amended 2-14-2006

to the City Council. [Amended 2-14-2006 by Ord. No. 2006-22]

hearing. There shall be a stenographic record of the public hearing. The
City Council shall, within 21 days of the hearing, either determine not
to revoke the franchise or, upon stated grounds, revoke the franchise
absolutely or conditionally or remand the matter to the Mayor to
impose penalties pursuant to § 4A-26.
A. No assignment by a franchisee of its franchise shall be made without
the prior approval of the City Council by an ordinance duly adopted
by 3/4 of all the members of the Council. Such approval shall not be
withheld unreasonably. The proposed transferee must show technical
ability, financial capability, legal qualifications and general character
qualifications as determined by the City and must agree to comply with
all provisions of this chapter and the franchise agreement and such
additional conditions as may be prescribed by the City Council
expressed in the ordinance.
B. Any single transfer of 10% or more of a franchisee's ownership, be it by
stock or partnership interest, shall be reported to the Mayor within 30
days after the consummation of the transfer.
C. Any transfer of the controlling interest in a franchisee, either de facto
or de jure, shall automatically terminate a franchise granted to the
franchisee, unless the franchisee seeks and obtains approval of the
transfer by the City Council within three months after the effective date
of the transfer. Such approval shall be by ordinance duly adopted by 3/4
of all the members of the Council.
D. Any combination of single transfers of the equity ownership of a
franchisee or its parent, within any six-month period, that aggregates
25% or more of such ownership shall create a rebuttable presumption
of de facto transfer of control and shall be subject to the provisions of
Subsection C above.
E. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no approval of the City Council shall be
required if a franchisee assigns or transfers its franchise to any parent
of the franchisee or to a partnership in which any parent holds the
majority interest and is also the general and managing partner. For the
purposes of this subsection, "parent" shall mean a corporate entity that

of the City Council to transfer control of the franchise shall be required.
§ 4A-10. Bankruptcy and receivership.

ensure adequate and uninterrupted cable television service, in the event
that a franchisee or any parent organization of a franchisee seeks protection
from creditors in any judicial forum, including filing a petition in
bankruptcy, or is involuntarily placed in bankruptcy or receivership, the
Corporation Council shall immediately seek an order compelling
assumption or rejection of the franchise agreement and providing that no
assumption shall be effective unless any default is cured and adequate
assurance is provided for future performance of the franchise agreement.
No assignment of the franchise agreement to any entity shall be permitted
unless the City Council shall, in its discretion, find such entity to be
technically, financially and legally qualified as a cable operation, nor shall
any such assignment contain provisions less stringent or less beneficial to
the subscribers and the City than those set forth in the franchise agreement.
The City shall retain the right to pursue any and all other remedies which
may be available under federal or state law at the time of such occurrence.

pledge of a franchise, the system, a franchisee's equity ownership or
any part thereof for the purpose of securing debt capital.

be deemed automatic and immediate revocation of the franchise.

easement to construct, erect, place, operate, repair and maintain poles,
wires, transmission lines, distribution lines, service lines and cable
television and communications equipment in and on, under and over all
public streets, lands and places in the City for the purpose of furnishing
the City and its inhabitants with cable and noncable services.
B. A franchisee shall not erect any poles on the streets of the City without
the prior approval of the City Engineer as to specific locations.
Whenever the telephone or other utility companies have erected poles,
a franchisee shall be expected to enter into a joint use agreement for
those poles. A franchisee shall not apply to the City Engineer to erect its
§ 4A-8 CABLE TELEVISION § 4A-11
4A:477
own poles unless a franchisee has been unable in good faith to enter
into such joint use agreement.
C. In those areas of the City where no poles exist and where a franchisee
has not secured the City Engineer's approval to install its own poles,
which approval shall not be withheld unreasonably, all wiring of the
system shall be constructed underground.
D. In those areas of the City where it is deemed reasonable by the City
Engineer, a franchisee may utilize the existing easements, conduits and
so forth of the underground City fire alarm-telegraph system.
E. Prior to the commencement of any construction, including
reconstruction, rebuild or upgrade, of any part of the system, a

any construction without receipt of such permits, which shall not be
delayed or withheld unreasonably.

The City shall have the right reasonably to condition and limit the
construction work of a franchisee to assure a minimum of

requesting households in such areas of a higher installation rate not to
exceed the franchisee's actual and direct costs divided equally among
the number of requesting households.
M. For subscribers requesting connection requiring an aerial drop line or
underground drop line in excess of 150 feet, a franchisee shall extend
cable service at the regular installation rate for the first 150 feet and at
a rate not to exceed the franchisee's actual costs of installation for the
distance exceeding 150 feet.
N. The system shall be constructed so as to provide an emergency alert

franchisee shall not cut or damage said trees to any greater extent that
is reasonably necessary for the construction, erection, installation,

request and may receive from the Mayor reasonable extensions of time
to comply with or a waiver of this requirement.
T. A franchisee shall be required, at its expense, to protect, support,
temporarily disconnect, relocate in or remove from public streets, lands

franchisee may be required, at its expense, to move any part or all of its
equipment and facilities from any public streets, lands or places upon
the termination or revocation of the franchise, as may be directed by
the Mayor upon reasonable notice, provided that such direction is in

holding a building moving permit issued by the City shall temporarily
raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of buildings. The direct
and actual expense of such temporary removal, raising or lowering of
wires shall be paid to the franchisee, by the person, firm or corporation
requesting the same, and the franchisee shall have the authority to
require such payment in advance. The franchisee shall be given not less
than 48 hours' advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire
changes.
A. A franchisee that operates a cable system with a channel capacity of not
more than 40 channels shall provide one public access channel, one
educational access channel, one government access channel and one

§ 4A-14. Public access.
discrete channel for the exclusive use of the City government, which,
among other uses, shall be the exclusive channel for cablecasting
meetings of local government agencies, boards, commissions and
legislatures. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a franchisee shall not be
obligated to make available a second public access channel until the
first public access channel shall have been used an average of 12 hours
per days during a ninety-day period.
C. A franchisee shall be permitted to use time on one or more access
channels whenever there are no blank channels available on the same
level of service which includes the access channel and whenever such
access channel is not scheduled for use 72 hours in advance of such
time or times desired by the franchisee, provided that any use of such
access channel by the franchisee shall at all times be subordinate to
designated access use and shall terminate or be preempted by access
programming scheduled 72 hours in advance. All nonaccess
programming on access channels shall be identified as such by an
appropriate announcement made prior to and following each nonaccess
use. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at such time as any access channel
on a cable system with a channel capacity in excess of 40 channels has
been programmed for a daily average of eight hours during any ninetyday
period, use of such channel by the franchisee shall be suspended
for such time as such minimum access use of such channel is
maintained.
D. A franchisee shall submit to the daily newspapers of general circulation
within the City for listing and publication in such newspapers the
programming available on each of the access channels, at the same
time and in the same form as the submission of other programming to
such newspapers, provided that the administrator or operator of such a
channel gives the franchisee the necessary programming information in
a timely manner. A franchisee shall publish the programming available
on each of the access channels in its own programming guide (if any),
subject to the same proviso.
A. Public access is the means for enabling individuals or organizations
within the community to communicate via the cable television medium

would be of interest to viewers in the community. This communication
may take any of the following forms:
(1) Programming produced using studio equipment and facilities;
(2) Programming produced using electronic field equipment and
facilities; and
(3) Programming converted from the use of consumer equipment.
B. In order to achieve the foregoing purposes:

facilities of industrial-grade quality sufficient to administer and
operate the channel, as listed more specifically in the franchise
agreement;
(3) The franchisee shall provide the corporation annually at the
beginning of each year a grant of money to be used by the
corporation for the administration and operation of the channel, as
well as for the maintenance, repair and replacement, including
upgrade, of the equipment and facilities, the initial amount of the
grant to be specified in the franchise agreement;
(4) The amount of the annual grant will increase each franchise year in
proportion to the increase during the previous franchise year in the
consumer price index, but in no event less than 5%;
(5) The annual grant shall be financed:
(a) One-half by a monthly surcharge of equal amount to each
subscriber, which may be itemized by the franchisee on the
monthly bill; and
(b) One-half by the franchisee;
(6) The franchisee shall publicize at least quarterly on its cable
advertiser-supported channels, at least quarterly in its bills and
monthly in its own program guide the existence of public access for
potential users; and
(7) The corporation shall enter into a contract of one or more years
with the City regarding the administration and operation of the
channel, which contract shall contain such terms and conditions as
the Mayor shall deem appropriate; provided, however, that the
contract shall contain at least the following terms and conditions:
(a) In order to be trained, use the equipment and facilities and
cablecast programming, individuals shall be residents of the
City and organizations shall have an office located in the City,
in which case their representatives need not be residents of the
City;
(b) Procedures for training, use of equipment and facilities and
cablecasting shall be designed to assure swiftness of access,
broad public availability and nondiscrimination or

4A:482
§ 4A-15. Required services.
(c) A substantial amount of the programming shall be produced in
the Rochester metropolitan statistical area and shall be related

the equipment, facilities and services offered in its proposal for
franchise renewal.
B. A franchisee shall offer to subscribers a wide diversity of cable services
and programming generally available to the cable television industry
and substantially reflecting the varied needs and interests of the
residents of the City. More particularly, a franchisee shall further offer
at least 3,500 hours of programming per month in the nine broad
categories of video programming listed on Appendix A.206 In addition, a
franchisee shall further offer at least 600 hours per month of
programming primarily of interest to members of each of the two
principal minority/ethnic population groups within the City, as revealed
by the 1990 United States census; each of these sets of programming
will also be considered a broad category of programming. Programming
in the broad categories of video programming shall not include
programming on the access channels and the premium channels. The
establishment of broad categories of video programming is not
intended to establish any specific programming requirements within
any category. A franchisee may abandon any broad category of video
programming if no programming in the category is available to the
franchisee or programming in the category is available to the
franchisee only upon either the payment of a charge, however labeled,
substantially in excess of any such payment in effect at the beginning of
206. Editor's Note: Appendix A is on file in the office of the City Clerk, where it may be
inspected during regular office hours.

the franchise term and not compensated for through a rate increase
or other adjustment, or the adherence to terms and conditions
substantially more restrictive than any such terms and conditions in
effect at the beginning of the franchise term, neither of which (payment
or adherence) is self-imposed or within the franchisee's reasonable
control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall
prevent a franchisee from packaging one or more broad categories of
programming in a tier and offering the tier to its subscribers.
C. A franchisee shall offer to subscribers a reduced level of cable service
consisting of substantially fewer channels than the full-channel
capacity of the franchisee's cable system. Such level of service shall
include the local television broadcast signals, provided they are
available and the provisions of 17 U.S.C. § 111(c) and (d), regarding a
compulsory license for secondary transmissions by cable systems,
remain in full force and effect; the government and one public access
channel to be specified by the Mayor if there are more than one, and
such other channels and programming generally available to the cable
television industry and reflecting the varied needs and interests of the
residents of the City as may be selected by the franchisee in its sole
discretion. A franchisee shall charge subscribers for this level of cable
service a monthly rate that is lower than the monthly rate charged
subscribers for the franchisee's full-channel service, exclusive of
premium or pay-per-view programming services, and that is
commensurate with such reduced level of service.
A. A franchisee shall maintain all equipment and segments of the cable
system in good condition throughout the entire franchise period.
B. A franchisee shall make cable system repairs promptly and interrupt
cable service only for a good cause and for the shortest time possible.
Any such interruptions, insofar as possible, except in emergency
situations, shall occur only during periods of minimal cable system use.
A franchisee shall not interrupt service for any purpose within its
reasonable control without advising its subscribers during the previous
24 hours by means of repeated alphanumeric notices on its channels.
C. A franchisee shall, throughout the entire franchise period, meet the
technical, operational and maintenance standards and quality of cable

shall maintain records of its compliance with these standards, and such
records shall be available for inspection by the Mayor upon reasonable
notice during normal business hours.
D. A franchisee shall simultaneously provide the City with a full copy of its
annual proof of performance tests required by and submitted to the
New York State Commission on Cable Television.

§ 4A-17. Subscriber rates.
A franchisee shall set forth its initial rates for its services for informational
purposes in the franchise agreement.
§ 4A-18. Consumer service standards.
E. A franchisee shall not allow its cable or other operations to interfere
with television reception of persons not serviced by the franchisee, nor
shall the cable system interfere with, obstruct or hinder in any manner
the operation of the various utilities serving the residents of the City.

shall be open during all usual business hours, have a publicly-listed
local telephone number or numbers and be so operated that complaints
and requests for service or repairs shall be received on a twenty-fourhour
basis. Subscribers shall be promptly notified of any change of
address of such office or of telephone number(s). The franchisee shall
obtain and maintain sufficient telephone lines and staffing so as to be
able to connect a telephone caller to a live personal representative or a
recorded current status report within one minute between 8:00 a.m.
and 11:00 p.m. seven days a week and so that a telephone caller will
receive a busy signal no more than three percent of the time under
normal operating circumstances.
B. A franchisee shall maintain the means to be capable of responding to
and to commence resolving subscriber complaints or requests for
service within 24 hours after receipt of the complaint or request. No
charge shall be made to the subscriber for this service unless such
maintenance or repair is required as a result of damage caused by the
subscriber, in which case such charge shall be fair and equitable.
C. A franchisee shall notify a subscriber in advance of the approximate
expected time of a service visit. Such notification shall indicate whether
the anticipated visit will be before or after noon. A franchise shall make
its best efforts to accommodate subscribers as to their choice of
morning, afternoon, evening or weekend visits.
D. All personnel, agents and representatives of a franchisee, including
subcontractors, shall wear photo-identification badges, prominently
displayed, when acting on behalf of the franchisee.
E. Any person having a complaint concerning the construction, operation
or maintenance of the system shall have the right to complain orally or
in writing to a franchisee. The franchisee shall establish and submit to
the Mayor for approval procedures for receiving, acting upon and
resolving subscriber complaints. At the time of initial subscription to a
franchisee's service and annually thereafter, a franchisee shall provide
to each subscriber a written statement setting forth the information and
procedures necessary for the subscriber to register any complaint. A

4A:485
telephone number for service shall be displayed on all subscriber bills
and in the Rochester telephone directory.

resolve complaints within 24 hours of receipt or at the latest on the next
working day, unless the subscriber requests a later date.
G. A franchisee shall make a record of all complaints and the disposition of
each; such records shall be maintained for a period of two years and
shall be subject to inspection by the Mayor upon reasonable notice
during ordinary business hours.
H. The Mayor shall appoint a City Cable Television Compliance Officer to
be responsible for assuring that all reasonable steps have been taken to
satisfactorily resolve complaints. The complaint officer shall conduct
investigations of unresolved complaints as deemed necessary to
effectuate resolution. Such officer shall maintain records of all
complaints and their disposition and shall retain copies for a period of
two years.
I. In the event that any complainant is unsatisfied with a franchisee's
attempts to resolve a complaint, such complainant may register a
complaint orally or in writing directly with the City Cable Television
Compliance Officer who shall promptly investigate the complaint and
attempt to resolve it.
J. Reliability of service; tests and analyses.
(1) When there exists substantial evidence, in the form of subscriber
complaints or otherwise, which in the judgment of the City Cable
Television Compliance Officer casts doubt on the reliability or
quality of cable service, the City Cable Television Compliance
Officer may notify a franchisee, in writing, that it is required to test,
analyze and report on the problematic aspect(s) of the cable
system. Such report shall be delivered to the Cable Television
Compliance Officer no later than 30 days after the Cable Television
Compliance Officer's formal notification and shall include the
following information: the nature of the complaints or evidence
which precipitated the special test(s); which cable system
component(s) was/were tested, the equipment used and
procedure(s) employed in said testing; the results of such test(s);
and the method(s) by which said complaints or problems were
resolved.
(2) The Cable Television Compliance Officer may require that tests and
analyses shall be supervised by a professional engineer not on the
permanent staff of a franchisee. The engineer shall be selected by
the City after consultation with the franchisee. The engineer shall
sign all records of the special tests and forward to the Cable
Television Compliance Officer such records with a report
interpreting the results of the tests and analyses and
recommending actions to be taken by a franchisee and the City. The
§ 4A-18 ROCHESTER CODE § 4A-18
4A:486
engineer shall base his or her report on the tests and analyses.
All the expenses of implementing these requirements shall be at
the cost of a franchisee; provided, however, that if the report
by the engineer establishes that the franchisee is in substantial
compliance with required technical standards and performance
specifications or fails to show noncompliance, then the City will pay
the costs of such engineer. [Amended 2-14-2006 by Ord. No.
2006-22]
K. Upon request by a subscriber, a franchisee shall credit all affected
subscriber's accounts on a pro rata basis for loss of cable service
commencing four hours after a franchisee is notified of such loss. A
franchisee shall, at the time of initial subscription to the cable system
and annually thereafter, furnish a notice to subscribers of their right to
a refund for any loss or interruption of cable service for 24 hours or
more.
L. A franchisee shall not discriminate in the provision of cable services,
including access thereto, against any subscriber, channel user or
general citizen on the basis of age, race, color, creed, religion, national
origin, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, disability or residential
income of a local area.
M. A franchisee shall not, in its charges or rates or in the availability of the
services or facilities of its system, make or grant advantages or

service offerings, options, prices and credit policies.
O. Within seven days of the receipt of any request for connection from any

cable services, which right shall last until the earlier of either initiation
of physical installation or provision of the services on the premises.
Q. A franchisee shall provide, upon request, to any subscriber who
subscribes to pay television or to similar premium services, a discretion
key which enables the subscriber to prevent utilization of the premium
channels on his or her television set. A franchisee shall provide such
key at its cost. [Amended 2-14-2006 by Ord. No. 2006-22]
R. In the operation of its system, a franchisee shall not interfere in any way
with the right of any resident to utilize an individual antenna for the
purpose of receiving television and other signals off the air.

4A:487
S. Upon termination of service to any subscriber and after receipt of a
written request therefor from the subscriber, a franchisee shall
promptly remove all facilities and equipment from the premises of such
subscriber, unless such facilities and/or equipment are located within
the subscriber's walls or are underground.
T. A franchisee shall not disconnect or discontinue service for delinquency
in payment without complying with the applicable rules and regulations
of the New York State Commission on Cable Television which require at
least five days' prior written notice to the subscriber and provision to
the subscriber of an opportunity to cure the delinquency at the time of
discontinuance or disconnection. Where a franchisee has improperly
disconnected or discontinued service, it shall provide free
reconnection.
U. Personal privacy of subscribers.
(1) A franchisee shall strictly observe and protect the right of personal
privacy of subscribers and users of its cable system at all times. At
the time of first providing any cable service or other service to a
subscriber and at least once a year thereafter, a franchisee shall
provide notice in the form of a separate, written statement to such
subscriber which clearly and conspicuously informs the subscriber
of:
(a) The nature of personally identifiable information collected or
to be collected with respect to the subscriber and the nature of
the use of such information;
(b) The nature, frequency and purpose of any disclosure which
may be made of such information, including an identification of
the types of persons to whom the disclosure may be made;
(c) The period during which such information will be maintained
by a franchisee;
(d) The times and place within the City at which the subscriber
may have access to such information; and

information" includes without limitation a subscriber's name;
address; telephone number; employment, credit and financial data;
programming or viewing habits or preferences; commercial
product preferences; economic, political and social opinions
derived from any polls or surveys; and any other information that
would identify or reasonably tend to identify an individual
subscriber or the members of a subscriber's household or a
subscriber's invitees or employees. The term "personally
§ 4A-18 ROCHESTER CODE § 4A-18
4A:488
identifiable information" does not include any record of aggregate
data which does not identify particular persons.
(3) Collection of information.
(a) Except as provided in Subsection U(3)(b) a franchisee shall not
use its cable system to collect personally identifiable
information concerning any subscriber without the prior
written consent of the subscriber concerned.

authorizing such disclosure, as provided in Subsection

the person to whom the order is directed; or
[3] Made only in order to disclose the names and addresses of
subscribers to any cable service or other service if the
franchisee has provided the subscriber the opportunity to
prohibit or limit such disclosure and the disclosure does
not reveal, directly or indirectly, any other personally
identifiable information.
(5) A franchisee shall not monitor any subscriber terminal without
prior written consent of the subscriber concerned; provided,
however, that the franchisee may conduct cable system-wide or
individually addressed sweeps for the purpose of verifying cable
system integrity. A franchisee shall not initiate a subscriber
response mechanism without a finding by the Mayor that the cable
system can operate effectively and yet provide absolute protection
against any invasion of personal privacy. Failure to provide such a
finding or to indicate obstacles to such a finding within 30 days of
§ 4A-18 CABLE TELEVISION § 4A-18
4A:489
receipt of a request therefor shall be deemed a waiver of this
requirement.
(6) Subscriber consent to collect and access information.

be conducted; such consent shall not be valid more than one
year after its date. No consent to collect or disclose personally
identifiable information beyond that necessary to provide cable
service shall be required by a franchisee as a condition of
receiving cable service. Any consent to disclose such
information may be revoked by a subscriber at any time by
delivering to the franchisee a written, signed and dated
statement of revocation, which shall be effective immediately
upon receipt.
(b) A subscriber shall be provided access to all personally
identifiable information regarding that subscriber which is
collected and maintained by a franchisee. Such information
shall be made available to the subscriber at reasonable times
and at a place within the City designated by the franchisee. A
subscriber shall be provided reasonable opportunity to correct
any error in such information.

collected and there are no pending requests, requirements or
orders for access to such information.
(8) A governmental entity may obtain personally identifiable
information concerning a subscriber pursuant to a court order only
if, in the court proceeding relevant to such court order, such entity
offers clear and convincing evidence that the subject of the
information is reasonably suspected of engaging in criminal activity
and that the information sought would be material evidence in the
case and the subject of the information is afforded the opportunity
to appear and contest such entity's claim.
(9) Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit a franchisee from
contracting for billing services, provided that any contractor

nuclear, radiological, chemical, bacteriological, or biological means or other
weapons or processes.

the provisions of any general, special, or local law other than this chapter.
EMERGENCY INTERIM SUCCESSOR  A person designated pursuant to
this chapter for possible temporary succession to the powers and duties, but
not the office, of a City officer in the event that neither such officer nor any

office.

the result of injury, disease or exposure, or the property of a substantial
number of such residents is imperiled, damaged, or destroyed, and it is

C. Bid security. [Amended 2-14-2006 by Ord. No. 2006-22]
(1) When deemed necessary by the Purchasing Agent, he or she shall
prescribe a bid security of a certified check, money, bonds or other
obligations as a condition precedent to the consideration of a bid.
Such bid security shall be set forth in the invitation for bids. No
bond shall be submitted to the City having as surety thereon, either
as coinsurer or as reinsurer, any surety company not authorized to
do business in the State of New York. All bid securities shall be
subject to approval by the City as to form and sufficiency of surety.
(2) The Purchasing Agent, after the bids have been opened, shall retain
the bid security of the three lowest bidders, and may in his or her
discretion return the bid security of all other bidders. The
Purchasing Agent shall also retain the bid securities of the three
lowest bidders for 10 days following an award of a contract,
notwithstanding that such award shall be the first or any
subsequent award. A bidder may withdraw his or her bid security
not less than 10 days after an award of the contract within the time
specified, or if no award of the contract be made, within 45 days
after the date of opening bids therefor, whichever date is later, and
upon such withdrawal his or her bid security shall be forthwith
returned. The Purchasing Agent shall forthwith return all bid
securities in the event all bids are rejected, and he and she may
return any bid security which a bidder is entitled to withdraw.
(3) A bidder shall forfeit any bid security required upon failure on his
or her part to execute a contract in a form approved by the City and
to furnish the required insurance and security within 10 days after
the award, or within such other time as may be specified in the
invitation for bids. A bidder shall be deemed to have failed to
execute any contract upon failure on his or her part to provide or
make available any materials or documents required to be so made
by the invitation for bids or by law within 10 days after request
therefor by the City, or within such other time as may be specified
in the invitation for bids or by law.
D. Bid opening procedure. Sealed bids and sealed offers, as that term
applies to contracts, shall be submitted to the Purchasing Agent and
shall be publicly opened and read at the time and place stated in the
advertisement for bids. The Purchasing Agent is authorized to accept
sealed bids and sealed offers submitted in an electronic format
§ 8A-7 CONTINUITY OF GOVERNMENT § 8A-7
7:515
pursuant to the requirements of § 103 of the General Municipal Law
of the State of New York. A tabulation of all bids received shall be
prepared and made available for public inspection. [Amended
1-19-2016 by Ord. No. 2016-6]
E. Rejection of bids. The Purchasing Agent is authorized to reject any or
all bids or parts of bids when the interests of the City will be served
thereby. [Amended 1-19-2016 by Ord. No. 2016-6]
F. Bid modifications and mistakes.
(1) Late modification. A late modification of the otherwise successful
bid shall be opened at any time it is received; and if in the judgment
of the Purchasing Agent it makes the terms of the bid more
favorable to the City, it shall be considered.
(2) Minor informalities or irregularities in bids. The Purchasing Agent
shall either give a bidder an opportunity to cure any deficiency
resulting from a minor informality or irregularity in a bid or waive
such deficiency, whichever is to the advantage of the City.
(3) Mistakes in bids. Where a mistake in a bid is alleged prior to award
and where the bid, as submitted, is responsive to the invitation for
bids, the Purchasing Agent, with the approval of the Corporation
Counsel, may: [Amended 2-14-2006 by Ord. No. 2006-22]
(a) Determine that the bidder may withdraw his or her bid where
the bidder requests permission to do so and clear and
convincing evidence establishes the existence of a mistake;
however, if the evidence is clear and convincing both as to the
existence of a mistake and as to the bid actually intended, and
if the bid, both as uncorrected and corrected, is the one most
favorable to the City, the Purchasing Agent may correct the bid
and not permit its withdrawal.
(b) Determine that the bidder may correct his or her bid where the
bidder requests permission to do so and clear and convincing
evidence establishes both the existence of a mistake and the
bid actually intended, provided that such correction shall not
be made where it would result in displacing one or more bids,
unless the existence of the mistake and the bid actually
intended are ascertainable substantially from the invitation
and the bid itself.
(4) When a determination is made concerning an alleged bid mistake, a
full and complete statement of the reasons for making the
determination shall be prepared by or under the direction of the
Purchasing Agent, which statement shall be filed with the other
papers relating to the transaction.
(5) Unless the Purchasing Agent determines, as provided in this
section, that a bid may be withdrawn or corrected, no plea of
§ 8A-7 ROCHESTER CODE § 8A-7
7:516
mistake in a bid shall be available to the bidder for the recovery
of his or her bid security or as a defense to any action based
upon such bid, except with the approval of 3/4 of the City Council.
[Amended 2-14-2006 by Ord. No. 2006-22]
G. Award of contract.
(1) The Purchasing Agent is authorized to award and execute contracts
within the purview of this chapter with the lowest responsible
bidder whose proposal shall conform to the invitation for bids. The
Purchasing Agent is further authorized to award and execute
purchase contracts for supplies and contractual services (except
for purchase contracts necessary for the completion of public
works pursuant to Article 8 of the Labor Law), on the basis of best
value pursuant to the requirements of § 103 of the General
Municipal Law of the State of New York. [Amended 1-19-2016 by
Ord. No. 2016-6]
(2) Determination of responsibility and nonresponsibility. No purchase
shall be made from, and no contract shall be awarded to, any
bidder unless the Purchasing Agent first determines that the bidder
is responsible. The bidder shall demonstrate affirmatively
responsibility, including, when necessary, that of proposed
subcontractors. Any failure by a bidder to supply or to make
available any materials or documents required by the Purchasing
Agent or by any other officers of the City for the purpose of
determining the bidder's responsibility shall subject the bidder to
forfeiture of any bid security. In determining the responsibility of a
bidder, the Purchasing Agent shall consider: [Amended
11-10-1992 by Ord. No. 92-403; 5-11-1993 by Ord. No.
93-150]
(a) The adequacy of the bidder's financial resources or ability to
obtain such resources. The Purchasing Agent may require that
any bidder submit verified statements as to financial
responsibility and experience, which statements shall be made
on forms prescribed by the Purchasing Agent. Supplemental
statements may be required at any time.
(b) The ability of the bidder to comply with the required or
proposed delivery or performance schedule.
(c) The record of performance of the bidder and any proposed
subcontractors on other contracts, and particularly on similar
contracts had with the City.
(d) The record of integrity of the bidder.
(e) The availability to the bidder of the necessary organization,
experience, operational controls and technical skills, and the
necessary production, construction and technical equipment
and facilities required for performance of the contract.
§ 8A-7 CONTINUITY OF GOVERNMENT § 8A-7
7:517
(f) The compliance by the bidder with any special or general
standards of responsibility set forth in the invitation for bids.
(g) The compliance by the bidder with any other standards which
may be established by the Purchasing Agent pursuant to rule
or regulation.
(h) No bidder shall be determined to be responsible who is in
default on the payment of any taxes, licenses or other moneys
due the City, or who has defaulted within two years for any
reason on a contract had with the City.
(i) The Purchasing Agent shall inform a bidder in writing of a
nonresponsibility determination and the reasons therefor.
(j) Upon making a nonresponsibility determination, the
Purchasing Agent may bar the bidder and affiliated
organizations, as further set forth herein, from bidding on City
contracts for a period of not to exceed two years. If a
corporation is found to be a nonresponsible bidder, that finding
may be applied to a parent, affiliate or subsidiary corporation,
if the Purchasing Agent finds that an officer, director or person
directly or indirectly controlling 10% or more of the stock of
the corporation found to be nonresponsible is an officer,
director or person directly or indirectly controlling 10% or
more of the stock of the parent, affiliate or subsidiary
corporation. If an unincorporated association is found to be
nonresponsible, that finding may be extended to other related
associations upon a finding by the Purchasing Agent that the
related associations have substantially the same ownership,
management or operating personnel.
(3) Guidelines for responsibility determinations for the award of public
works contracts and contracts for services. [Added 3-18-1997 by
Ord. No. 97-111225; amended 8-24-2004 by Ord. No. 2004-36]
(a) In determining the responsibility of a bidder for a public works
contract or a contract for services in excess of $50,000, or a
contract for services that is not in a fixed amount if in either of
the prior two years a substantially similar contract was in
excess of $50,000, the Purchasing Agent shall consider the
following items in addition to the requirements already
established in Subsection G(2) above. In the case of a contract
for services that is bid in two or more parts, this section shall
apply if the combined total of all such parts exceeds $50,000:
[1] Lack of adequate expertise, prior experience with
comparable projects or financial resources to perform the
work of the contract in a timely, competent and acceptable

evidence of insurance, surety bonds or financial
responsibility; the status of bankruptcy petitions;
suspension or debarment by state or federal government;
or a history of termination of prior contracts for cause.
[2] Criminal conduct in connection with government contracts
or business activities. Evidence of such conduct may
include a judgment of conviction or information obtained
as a result of a formal grant of immunity in connection
with a criminal prosecution of the bidder, any director or
officer, or holder of 5% or more of the shares or equity of
the bidder or any affiliate of the bidder.
[3] Violations of safety and/or training standards as evidenced
by a pattern of OSHA violations or the existence of willful
OSHA violations.
[4] Willful noncompliance with the prevailing wage and
supplements payment requirements of the Labor Law by

[5] Any other significant Labor Law violations, including but
not limited to Child Labor Law violations, failure to pay
wages or unemployment insurance tax delinquencies.
[6] Any significant violation of the Workers' Compensation
Law, including but not limited to the failure of a bidder to
provide proof of workers' compensation or disability
benefits coverage.
[7] Any criminal conduct involving violations of the
Environmental Conservation Law or other federal or state
environmental statutes, or repeated or significant civil
violations of federal or state environmental statutes or
regulations.
[8] Any criminal conviction concerning formation of, or any
business association with, an allegedly false or fraudulent
women's or minority business enterprise (W/MBE), or any
denial, decertification, revocation or forfeiture of W/MBE
status by New York State.
[9] Any other cause of so serious or compelling a nature that it
raises questions about the responsibility of a bidder,
including but not limited to submission to the City of a
false or misleading statement on a sworn statement of
§ 8A-7 CONTINUITY OF GOVERNMENT § 8A-7
7:519
bidder qualifications, or in some other form, in connection
with a bid for or award of a contract.
[10] In addition to the factors specified above, the Purchasing
Agent may also give due consideration to any other factors
considered to bear upon bidder responsibility, including
but not limited to, any mitigating factors brought to the
City's attention by the bidder.
(b) The Director of Finance shall develop rules and regulations to
implement these guidelines, including a sworn statement of
bidder qualifications to gather the information set forth above
in the guidelines. Said sworn statement shall be completed by
the apparent low bidder and the second low bidder on public
works contracts in excess of $50,000. The Purchasing Agent
shall use the information contained in the response to the
sworn statement in making a determination of bidder
responsibility before awarding the contract.
(4) A nonresponsibility determination by the Purchasing Agent may be
appealed by the bidder to the Director of Finance by delivery to the
Director of Finance of a written notice of appeal within 10 days
after receipt of the determination of the Purchasing Agent. The
Director of Finance shall offer the bidder an opportunity to be
heard, at which the Director of Finance or the Director's designee
shall preside. Such hearing shall be scheduled as soon as possible
after a request. The bidder shall be permitted to be represented by
counsel, to submit evidence and summon witnesses on his or her
behalf and to inspect documents and cross-examine opposing
witnesses. Compliance with the technical rules of evidence shall
not be required. The hearing officer, if other than the Director of
Finance, shall make a recommendation to the Director of Finance.
The Director of Finance shall make the final determination in
writing, based upon evidence produced at the hearing. In the final
determination, the Director of Finance may accept, reject or modify
the determination and penalty imposed by the Purchasing Agent.
The determination of the Director of Finance shall be subject to
review pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules.

2-14-2006 by Ord. No. 2006-22; 1-19-2016 by Ord. No. 2016-6]
All contracts for public work, and all purchase contracts, rentals and leases
of supplies, and all sales of personal property of the City which may be
purchased or sold without the formal contract procedure shall be made
on the open market. All open-market purchases shall, wherever feasible,
be based on at least three competitive bids, and shall be awarded to the
bidder who shall satisfy the Purchasing Agent as to his or her responsibility
and whose bid is most advantageous to the City, price and other factors
considered. All open-market sales shall, wherever feasible, be based on at
least two competitive bids, or through a public or Internet auction process,
or if such bids cannot reasonably be obtained, on such other form of
evaluation as the Purchasing Agent shall deem reasonable, and shall be
awarded to the responsible bidder whose bid is most advantageous to the
City, price and other factors considered. The Purchasing Agent shall solicit
bids by such method or methods as he or she deems suitable to insure open
and fair competition, including but not limited to direct mail, electronic

A. Except as provided in Subsection B of this section, contracts negotiated
on behalf of the City by the Purchasing Agent may be of any type which
in the opinion of the Purchasing Agent will promote the best interests of
the City. The Purchasing Agent shall determine that the method of
contracting for a negotiated contract is likely to be less costly than
other methods, that the prospective vendor is responsible, that the
supplies or contractual services to be provided are of the kind and
quality required by the City and that the price is fair and reasonable.
B. The cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost system of contracting shall not be
used, and in the case of a cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contract, the fee shall not
exceed 15% of the estimated cost of the contract, exclusive of the fee,
as determined by the Purchasing Agent at the time of entering into such
contract. The Purchasing Agent, or his or her designate, shall have the
right to inspect the plans and to audit the books and records of any
prime contractor or subcontractor engaged in the performance of a cost
or cost-plus-a-fixed-fee contract. [Amended 2-14-2006 by Ord. No.

any directly pertinent books, documents, papers and records of the
contractor or any of his or her subcontractors engaged in the
performance of and involving transactions related to such contracts or
subcontracts. Such clause may be omitted from contracts where the
Purchasing Agent determines, after taking into account the price and
availability of the property of services from other sources, that the
public interest would be best served by the omission of such clause.
[Amended 2-14-2006 by Ord. No. 2006-22]
A. The Purchasing Agent shall have the authority to require on any and all
contracts a performance bond for the faithful performance of the
contract and a payment bond for the protection of all persons supplying
labor and material in the prosecution of the work provided in the
contract in such amounts as he or she shall find reasonably necessary to
protect the best interests of the City. The Purchasing Agent shall
require such performance and payment bonds having a penal sum at
least equal to 50% of the total amount payable by the terms of the
contract on all contracts for contractual services involving an
expenditure of $100,000 or more. The Purchasing Agent may require
such performance or payment bonds at any time, notwithstanding that
the invitation for bids shall not specifically require performance or
payment bonds. [Amended 8-11-1992 by Ord. No. 92-325;
7-12-1994 by Ord. No. 94-214; 2-14-2006 by Ord. No. 2006-22]

performance or payment bond protection in the event that a
modification or aggregate of modifications to a contract may be

contract price, whichever is less, or if a modification is for new or
additional work which is beyond the scope of the existing contract.
[Amended 8-11-1992 by Ord. No. 92-325]
C. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection A of this section, where
the contract is not for the construction, alteration or repair of any
public building or other public work, the Purchasing Agent, with the
approval of the Director of Finance, may defer the filing and execution
of a performance or payment bond, provided that at least 50% of the
contract price shall be withheld until acceptance of the work under the
contract, and provided further that the bid security shall be retained in
lieu of all or any part of the performance and payment security. Upon
completion and acceptance of such work, the Purchasing Agent may
waive the execution and filing of the performance or payment bond.

essential to protect the life, health, safety or property of the inhabitants
of the City. The Purchasing Agent shall prescribe by rules and
regulations the procedure under which emergency purchases by heads
of using agencies may be made. The head of such using agency shall

disposition of surplus property. The Purchasing Agent is authorized to
dispose of surplus property by sale, exchange, lease, permit or transfer,
for cash, credit or other property, with or without warranty, and upon
such other terms and conditions as the Purchasing Agent deems proper,

other interest in property and take such other action as he or she deems
necessary or proper to dispose of such property under the provisions of
this chapter. Any transaction carried out under the authority of this
section shall be evidenced in writing. The Purchasing Agent shall not

A. Title and purpose. This section shall be known as the "Rochester Living
Wage Ordinance." The purpose of this section is to ensure that
employees of substantial City contractors and subcontractors earn an
hourly wage that is sufficient for a family to live at or above the federal
poverty guideline.
B. Definitions. The following definitions shall apply throughout this
section:
BUSINESS ASSISTANCE  Any grant or loan of at least $50,000
realized by or through the authority or approval of the City, excluding
welfare-to-work, job training or youth employment programs.
BUSINESS ASSISTANCE BENEFICIARY  Any direct recipient of at
least $50,000 of business assistance.
CASUAL EMPLOYEE  An occasional employee without regular or set
hours, or an employee regularly working fewer than 20 hours a week.
CITY  The City of Rochester.
226. Editor's Note: This ordinance provided that the provisions of this chapter that relate to
Business Assistance and Business Assistance Beneficiaries shall take effect upon
enactment of substantially similar legislation by Monroe County as determined by the
Mayor; all other provisions of this ordinance shall take effect on July 1, 2001.
§ 8A-17 ROCHESTER CODE § 8A-18
7:526
CONTRACTOR  Any person who enters into a service contract with
the City, except other governmental units.
COVERED EMPLOYEE  A person employed either part-time or fulltime
by the covered employer who directly expends his or her time
on a service contract with the City, for the time said person actually
spends on the service contract, or a person employed either part-time
or full-time by a business assistance beneficiary at a workplace which
has received business assistance from the City; provided, however,
that persons who are employed in construction work covered pursuant
to federal or state prevailing wage laws shall be exempt from this
section, as shall participants in welfare-to-work, job training or youth
employment programs, and workers with disabilities, full-time
students, messengers, learners, student-learners and apprentices for
whom the covered employer has received a certificate to pay special
minimum wages pursuant to Section 14 of the Federal Fair Labor
Standards Act (FLSA) (29 U.S.C. § 214). "Covered employee" shall not
include a casual employee or seasonal employee.
COVERED EMPLOYER  Any person who is a contractor or
subcontractor directly involved in providing a service to the City
pursuant to a service contract as defined herein.
PERSON  One or more of the following or their agents, employees,
representatives and legal representatives: individuals, corporations,
partnership, joint ventures, associations, labor organizations,
educational institutions, mutual companies, joint-stock companies,
trust, unincorporated organizations, trustees in bankruptcy, receivers,
fiduciaries and all other entities recognized at law by the City.
SEASONAL EMPLOYEE  An employee hired temporarily for a period
not to exceed 90 days at any given time within a six-month period.
SERVICE CONTRACT  A contract awarded to a contractor by the
City primarily for furnishing services to or for the City (excluding the
purchase of goods or other property, the leasing of property or the
development, redevelopment or rehabilitation of real property) and
that involves an expenditure by the City to the contractor of at least
$50,000, or the retention by the contractor of fees of at least $50,000,
during a period of one year. Said threshold of $50,000 shall not include
funds provided by the City to be passed through to eligible participants
in federal- or state-funded programs. For the purposes of this section
"service contract" shall not include any contract awarded through
competitive bidding pursuant to General Municipal Law § 103. "Service
contract" shall include unit price contracts that are designated by the
City, where, based on experience or expected level of work, the City
anticipates an expenditure to the contractor of at least $50,000 during
a period of one year. "Service contract" shall not include separate
contracts in amounts of less than $50,000 with the same contractor
for different services which may involve a total expenditure by the City
to the contractor of more than $50,000 during a period of one year.
However, contracts may not be segmented to fall under the threshold,
§ 8A-18 CONTINUITY OF GOVERNMENT § 8A-18
7:527
and multiple contracts with the same contractor for the same services
shall be aggregated to determine the total expenditure for purposes
of application of this section. Where an amendatory agreement or
additional agreement with the same contractor causes the total
expenditure to exceed $50,000 during a period of one year, this section
shall apply to the amendatory agreement or additional agreement.
SUBCONTRACTOR  Any person other than an employee that enters
into a contract with a contractor to assist the primary contractor in
performing a service contract, including any temporary employment
agency that enters into a contract with a contractor or business
assistance beneficiary to provide employees to assist the primary
contractor in performing a service contract or to perform services for
a business assistance beneficiary at a workplace which has received
business assistance from the City.
C. Living wage.
(1) Applicability. Covered employers and business assistance
beneficiaries shall pay no less than a living wage to their covered
employees, which, for covered employees working on a service
contract, shall be for the time directly expended on the service
contract.
(2) Amount of wage. The living wage shall be calculated on an hourly
basis as paying $8.52 to covered employees who are offered health
insurance benefits by the covered employer or business assistance
beneficiary and $9.52 to covered employees who are not offered
health insurance benefits by the covered employer or business
assistance beneficiary.
(3) Revision process. This section shall be reviewed and evaluated two
years after adoption in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the
legislation in terms of its policy goals, and monitoring and
enforcement procedures. The amount of the living wage shall be
increased annually to reflect inflation as captured by the
unadjusted consumer price index for all urban consumers (CPI-U),
United States city average, as published by the Bureau of Labor
statistics of the United States Department of Labor. The first
indexing adjustment shall occur July 1, 2002, in proportion to the
increase of the United States city average of the CPI-U at the
immediately preceding April 30 over the year earlier April 30, and
shall be adjusted every July 1 thereafter.
(4) No reduction in wage rates or hours. Nothing in this section shall
require or authorize any covered employer or business assistance
beneficiary to reduce wages or work hours of any covered
employee, and a covered employer or business assistance
beneficiary shall not reduce wages or work hours as a result of
coverage by this section, and this section shall not be construed so
as to reduce wages required under any prevailing wage law.
§ 8A-18 ROCHESTER CODE § 8A-18
7:528
(5) Notifying employees of their potential right to the federal earned
income credit. Covered employers and business assistance
beneficiaries shall inform employees making less than $12 per hour
of their possible right to the Federal Earned Income Credit (EIC)
under section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C.
§ 32, and shall make available to employees information about the
EIC and how to obtain forms required to secure advance EIC
payments from the employer.
(6) Tipped employees. Covered employers who elect to receive credit
for tips received by covered employees in accordance with the
provisions of the FLSA may also include as wages under this
section an additional amount on account of tips received by a
covered employee, provided that the tip amount is at least equal to
the difference between the wages paid the covered employee and
the living wage. The additional amount on account of tips may not
exceed the value of the tips actually received by the covered
employee. This subsection shall not apply to any covered employee
unless such employee has been informed by the covered employer
that his or her direct wages shall be less than the living wage,
provided that the amount of tips plus direct wages received by such
employee at least equals the living wage, and provided that all tips
received by such employee have been retained by the employee.
This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit the pooling of
tips among employees who customarily and regularly receive tips.
If a covered employee's tips combined with the covered employer's
direct wages do not equal the living wage, the covered employer
must make up the difference. It is the responsibility of the covered
employer to prove, upon request by the City, the payment of at least
a living wage in combined direct wages and tips to the covered
employee. FLSA requirements shall be applied to determine
eligibility for including tips as wages and calculating the total
amount of wages and tips.
D. Employer responsibility, compliance and sanctions.
(1) Application for contract or business assistance. Every proposal or
application for a service contract or business assistance shall
include a written commitment by the applicant to pay all covered
employees a living wage as defined by this section and shall include
a list of job titles and wage levels of all covered employees in each
of the years for which the contract or business assistance is sought.
(2) Reports from covered employers and business assistance
beneficiaries. Covered employers and business assistance
beneficiaries shall provide to the City publicly available annual
reports of job titles and wage rates of covered employees during
the term of the service contract or business assistance. For service
contracts or business assistance of less than one year, covered
employers and business assistance beneficiaries shall provide such
§ 8A-18 CONTINUITY OF GOVERNMENT § 8A-18
7:529
reports at the beginning and end of the contract or business
assistance.
(3) Compliance, enforcement and sanctions.
(a) Covered employer and business assistance beneficiary
cooperation. The covered employer or business assistance
beneficiary shall permit representatives from the City to
observe the work being performed at its place of work;
furthermore, the covered employer or the business assistance
beneficiary shall permit said representatives to interview
employees and to examine its books and records relating to
employment and payroll to determine if the covered employer
or the business assistance beneficiary is in compliance with the
provisions of this section. Covered employers and business
assistance beneficiaries shall maintain for a period of at least
three years all necessary records to document the wages paid
to each covered employee, and the time expended by each
covered employee on a service contract.
(b) Posting. Every covered employer and business assistance
beneficiary shall post and keep in conspicuous places on their
premises, where notices to employees and applicants for
employment are customarily posted, a notice supplied by the
City informing employees of their rights under this section.
Included in this posting shall be a phone number at the City
that covered employees may call to lodge complaints. If the
covered employer or subcontractor is a temporary employment
agency, this notice shall be mailed to all covered employees
before or in conjunction with the receipt of the covered
employees' first paycheck.
(c) Grievance procedure. A covered employee who believes that
his or her employer is not complying with requirements of this
section has the right to file a complaint with the City.
Complaints by covered employees of alleged violations shall be
made within one year of the date of the violation and shall be
investigated promptly by the City. Written and oral statements
made by a covered employee shall be treated as confidential
and shall not be disclosed to the covered employer or business
assistance beneficiary without the consent of the employee.
While protection of the employee's confidentiality shall be a
priority for the City, this provision shall not prevent the City
from informing the covered employer of the name of the
covered employee and the basis of the complaint in order to
access information necessary to investigate the complaint.
(d) Duties of the City.
[1] It shall be the responsibility of the City to create guidelines
for investigating and handling grievances under this
§ 8A-18 ROCHESTER CODE § 8A-18
7:530
section; to examine the pay rolls, as necessary, to
determine compliance and cause investigations to be
made, as necessary, to monitor compliance with the
provisions of this section.
[2] The City shall promptly investigate complaints alleging
noncompliance by covered employers and business
assistance beneficiaries. The contracting agency may, in
accordance with the powers herein granted, require the
production by the employer of such evidence as required
to determine compliance.
(e) Covered employer or business assistance beneficiary may
dispute finding of noncompliance. A covered employer or
business assistance beneficiary may dispute a finding of
noncompliance by requesting a hearing with a representative
of the City. A covered employer or business assistance
beneficiary must request such a hearing within 60 days after
receiving notice of a finding of noncompliance.
(f) Sanctions. A covered employer or business assistance
beneficiary found to be in violation of any provision in this
section shall be sanctioned as follows:
[1] The City shall withhold payment of so much of any amount
due in business assistance or on a service contract or on
any other contract in effect with the same covered
employer or business assistance beneficiary which is equal
to the alleged underpayment to a covered employee, order
wage restitution for each affected employee and serve a
written notice of violation on the covered employer or
business assistance beneficiary.
[2] For willful or repeated violations, the City shall
additionally impose a fine not to exceed $100 per day on
the covered employer or business assistance beneficiary
for each employee found to be paid less than the living
wage, and may order the covered employer or business
assistance beneficiary to repay business assistance
awarded by the City and any amounts paid on service
contracts for services not yet rendered terminate ongoing
service contracts or business assistance and declare the
covered employer or business assistance beneficiary
ineligible for further City service contracts or business
assistance for three years, after which time the covered
employer or business assistance beneficiary may be
eligible for reinstatement if all underpayments and fines
are paid.
[3] All sanctions will be a matter of public record.

§ 21-1. Acquisition of real property.
The acquisition of real property by the City of Rochester, through any means
other than in-rem foreclosure, is a function of the Division of Real Estate.
Acquisitions require the approval of City Council and are subject to the
following guidelines:
§ 21-2. Lease of property for municipal use.
A. The Director of Real Estate shall negotiate the purchase of real
property for municipal purposes. The appraised value of the property,
as determined by a professional independent appraisal, shall serve as
the basis for a settlement through negotiation or condemnation.
Easements (both permanent and temporary) and licenses shall also be
acquired in accordance with these procedures.
B. The Director of Real Estate may accept a donation of real estate when it
is deemed by the Commissioner of Neighborhood and Business
Development to be in the best interest of the City. [Amended
6-16-2009 by Ord. No. 2009-179]
C. Under federal programs, the Director of Real Estate may acquire
property using funds provided by the federal government.
D. Under the Blight Program, privately owned properties that are vacant
and have a blighting effect on the surrounding neighborhood may be
acquired through negotiation or condemnation, after efforts to work
with the owner to achieve code compliance have failed. The value of the
property, as established by a professional independent appraisal, shall
serve as the basis for settlement through negotiation or condemnation.
A. The Director of Real Estate is authorized to lease private property when
needed for municipal purposes. At the request of a City department, the
Division of Real Estate will recommend for consideration various sites
that are available for lease. After selection of a site by the department,
the Director of Real Estate shall negotiate lease terms and enter into a
rental agreement, subject to approval by City Council.
§ 20-58 ROCHESTER CODE § 21-2
19:592
§ 21-3. Relocation assistance.
When applicable, the Division of Real Estate shall administer relocation
programs to provide relocation assistance to individuals and businesses that
are displaced through acquisition of property by the City for municipal use.
§ 21-4. Sale of City-owned real property.
Real property owned by the City which has been acquired through tax
foreclosure proceedings or other means and is no longer needed for
municipal purposes may be sold by the Director of Real Estate, upon
approval by City Council, through any method authorized by statute, local
law or ordinance.
§ 21-5. Public auction sales.
All sales of City-owned real property at public auction shall be made by the
Director of Real Estate or his or her representative after notice of the sale
has been published at least once in an official newspaper of the City, subject
to the approval by City Council of the sale price and purchaser. Such sales
shall also be subject to the following terms and conditions:
B. The Director of Real Estate may, with approval of the Commissioner of
Neighborhood and Business Development, enter into a rental
agreement for a period of less than one year, on a month-to-month
basis. [Amended 5-16-2006 by Ord. No. 2006-94; 6-16-2009 by
Ord. No. 2009-179]
A. Deposits.
(1) The required deposit on an auctioned structure shall be $1,000 or
25% of the purchase price, whichever is greater, and the in-lieu of
tax payment which will cover a time period of approximately 12
months. At the time of the auction, the high bidder for a structured
property must secure the bid by immediately depositing with the
City the amount of $1,000, or a deposit deemed appropriate by the
Director of Real Estate, payable only in cash or cashier's check. In
the event that the total of the purchase price and in-lieu-of-tax
payment is less than $1,000, the purchaser shall be required to pay
the actual total of these two figures at the time of the auction.
[Amended 5-16-2006 by Ord. No. 2006-94]
(2) The required deposit on an auctioned vacant lot shall be $50,
payable only in cash or cashier's check. [Amended 5-16-2006 by
Ord. No. 2006-94]
(3) The amount of the minimum bids and deposits collected at the time
of sale may be changed at the discretion of the Director of Real
Estate due to special circumstances of the property.
B. Within a time period established by the Director of Real Estate, any
remaining balance of the twenty-five-percent deposit and an in-lieu-of-
§ 21-2 PUBLIC SAFETY § 21-5
19:593
tax payment covering a time period of approximately 12 months shall
be delivered to the Division of Real Estate. At this time, the high bidder
for a structured property must also apply in the Permit Office for a
certificate of occupancy. If the high bidder misses the deadline for
payment of the twenty-five-percent deposit, the high bidder shall forfeit
the initial amount deposited to secure the bid to the City as liquidated
damages. The Division of Real Estate shall then contact the second high
bidder. Within 30 days of the auction, the high bidder for a vacant lot
must submit a written development proposal to the Director of Real
Estate. When it is deemed appropriate by the Director of Real Estate,
high bidders for selected structures may also be required to submit a
written development proposal within 30 days of the auction.
C. After approval by City Council, the successful bidder must conditionally
close with the Law Department in a timely manner. At the conditional
closing, the purchaser shall be required to deposit the balance of the
purchase price with the City. From the date of conditional closing, the
purchaser shall have by contract a specified time period to repair all
building code violations cited by the Bureau of Buildings and Zoning, or
complete construction of an improvement on the formerly vacant lot as
signified by the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, or meet any other
applicable condition imposed by the City. Extensions may be granted, in
writing, by the Division of Real Estate. In such cases, the successful
bidder must pay to the City additional in-lieu-of-tax payments and any
other applicable City charges. In lieu of conditional closing, the
Director of Real Estate may provide for title to be passed through a
reverter deed which permits the City to retake title in the event that the
purchaser does not comply with conditions of the sale. The use of such
reverter deeds shall be upon terms and conditions, including financial
guaranties of rehabilitation, as the Director of Real Estate shall
establish. [Amended 5-16-2006 by Ord. No. 2006-94; 6-20-2017 by
Ord. No. 2017-170]
D. After notification by the Bureau of Buildings and Zoning that a
certificate of occupancy has been issued, or that other applicable Cityimposed
conditions have been met, the Division of Real Estate shall
notify the Law Department to record the deed. [Amended 5-16-2006
by Ord. No. 2006-94; 6-20-2017 by Ord. No. 2017-170]
E. The City shall provide only a title report for parcels of real property sold
at public auction. If the title to any portion of a property is not
insurable, the purchaser or the City shall have the right to cancel the
contract. In the event of such cancellation, by either party, any money
deposited with the City shall be returned to the purchaser and there
shall be no further liability on the part of either party. Responsibility for
obtaining title insurance or an abstract shall be with the purchaser.
F. All conveyances shall be by quitclaim deed and shall be executed on
behalf of the City by the Mayor. The Corporation Counsel is hereby
authorized, when, in his or her opinion, the interest of the City will be
promoted thereby, to procure title insurance for any property sold at

contract, which shall include but are not limited to the recording fee,

liens for City taxes or other City charges.
A. Pursuant to the provisions of § 5-28 of the Charter of the City of
Rochester, parcels of real property and the rights and easements
therein may be sold by the Director of Real Estate by negotiated sale
and without competitive bid, on such terms, prices and conditions as
shall be approved by the Council of the City of Rochester.
B. The sale price for real property sold by negotiated sale shall be
established by a professional independent appraisal. Exceptions may be
made if the Director of Real Estate estimates that the value of the real
property is $1,000 or less or the City has independently established
values for similar sales on file, which may be utilized by the Director of
Real Estate as comparables to establish the value of real property. In
such cases, the sale price shall be established by a City staff appraisal.
Exceptions may also be made for redemptions by former owners of
properties lost through tax foreclosure and properties which do not
receive bids at public auction, excluding owner-occupant auctions and
special sales, which may be offered by the Division of Real Estate at a
price established by the Director of Real Estate. [Amended 7-23-2002
by Ord. No. 2002-233]
C. Purchasers of real property sold through negotiated sale must pay the
City 25% of the purchase price in cash or cashier's check at the time of
the submission of an offer to purchase, as a deposit payment to become
part of the purchase price if the City Council approves the sale. Such
deposit payment shall be returned to the purchaser if the offer is not
accepted. Such deposit may be waived in the case of City-sponsored
housing development projects. [Amended 5-16-2006 by Ord. No.
2006-94]

through various owner-occupant programs, including but not
limited to the owner-occupant lottery, the owner-occupant auction and the
Tenant Ownership Program. Owner-occupant purchasers shall not own
other residential property and must meet the income guidelines established
by the Director of Real Estate. The sale price for real property sold at
an owner-occupant lottery shall be $1. The sale price for real property
sold at an owner-occupant auction shall be established through an open
competitive bidding process. The sale price for real property sold through
the Tenant Ownership Program shall be established by a professional
independent appraisal. All owner-occupant purchasers shall occupy the
purchased property after the date of issuance of a certificate of occupancy
for a minimum period of time as established by the Director of Real Estate,
provided that the minimum period shall be not less than three years if no
City funding is used in the purchase and not less than five years if any
City funding is used. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of
the sale agreements shall result in forfeiture of the deposit fee, and the
purchaser shall be prohibited from purchasing other City property for a
term of three years. Processing of owner-occupant sales shall proceed in the
same manner as with a sale by public auction.
§ 21-8. Request for proposal sale.
F. Nothing herein contained shall be construed as preventing the sale of
any real property acquired by the City in tax foreclosure proceedings,
and rights and easements therein, by public sale pursuant to law.
A. Real property may be sold through a request for proposal sale at an
auction or at a special sale when:
(1) The legal use of a property is different from the actual use;
(2) The rehabilitation cost is excessive to the average purchaser, and
the City wishes to screen purchasers regarding the cost estimates
and funding for the project;
(3) The parcel being sold is vacant land over 10,000 square feet in size,
where a proposal is required in order to ensure that the property is
to be developed in compliance with City codes and that the
purchaser has the ability to carry the proposal through to
completion;
(4) The unique development of a property is anticipated; or
(5) The Director of Real Estate deems the type of property sale to be in
the best interest of the City.

proposed reuse of the property, a timetable for complete rehabilitation
or construction work to be done, a description of all work to be done,
cost estimates for proposed work and verifiable sources of finances to
complete the project. The purchaser may include any required
contingencies such as bank financing, zoning or planning changes
which may be required. The proposal plan shall be reviewed by the
Commissioner of Neighborhood and Business Development and his or
her staff, as well as other appropriate departments and bureaus. If the
plan is disapproved, the purchaser's deposit shall be refunded. If the
plan is approved, the sale shall be processed in the same manner as a
sale by public auction. [Amended 6-16-2009 by Ord. No. 2009-179]
A. The Director of Real Estate may sell a parcel of real property by land
contract to a residential tenant, commercial tenant or industrial tenant
or at public sale. The sale price for real property sold through a land
contract sale shall be established by a professional independent
appraisal, unless the price is established at public auction. The Bureau
of Property Conservation and Inspection Services shall inspect all
properties sold through land contract and provide the purchaser with a
list of code violations. The purchaser must occupy the property during
the term of the land contract. A monthly payment schedule shall be
established which provides for equal monthly installments of principal
and interest, amortized for a period not to exceed 15 years. Such
payment schedule shall be in accordance with rules and regulations
established by the Director of Real Estate and shall include a monthly
payment to cover estimated future City taxes, embellishments and
water and pure waters charges during the term of the land contract
agreement. Upon recording of the deed to the property in the
purchaser's name, the purchaser shall become directly responsible for
payment of such charges. Nonpayment of a monthly payment within 30
days of the billing date constitutes default and subjects a land contract
to cancellation.

Division of Real Estate upon signing a land contract agreement. A
commercial or industrial tenant must deposit 25% of the purchase price
upon signing a land contract agreement. Purchasers at public auction
must follow the procedures set forth in § 21-5 of the Municipal Code.
Processing of such sale shall proceed in the manner set forth for the
sale of real property at public auction. A land contract purchaser shall
have nine months from the execution of the land contract agreement to
complete rehabilitation of the property and eliminate code violations

the right to periodically inspect the property to ensure property code
compliance. [Amended 6-20-2017 by Ord. No. 2017-170]
A. A conveyance of a property to the City through tax foreclosure may be
canceled, by court order, upon application of the Corporation Counsel,

discretion of the Director of Real Estate. Where sale of such a
foreclosed property to the former owner is deemed to be in the Citys
best interests by the Director of Real Estate, the sale price shall consist
of all City tax arrears, delinquent water bills, pure waters charges
previously paid by the City and any other City charges, interest to the
date of payment, a ten-percent penalty, the cost of a title report and all
current taxes. The former owner shall also pay all current county taxes
and charges and all county taxes and charges which had been canceled
through the foreclosure proceedings. The Director of Real Estate may
establish rules and regulations governing the eligibility of the various
categories of former owners and governing the time period in which
they may elect to repurchase their former property. Former owners
shall be screened in accordance with § 21-16 of the Municipal Code.

a parcel currently or formerly owned by the former owner, default in a
demolition hearing, or default on a City grant or loan agreement.

execute a standard City rental agreement. If the sale is not completed,
the City may deduct any back rent owed from deposits made by the
former owner as part of the purchase price. The former owner shall be
required to obtain a certificate of occupancy within a certain time after
City Council approval of the sale, as established by the Director of Real
Estate. Title shall transfer to the former owner upon obtaining the

owner shall pay the required meter fee, pursuant to § 23-37B, for any
new meter installed on the premises. When a meter is replaced in a
service with a new meter of the same size and the old meter is returned
to the Waterworks in satisfactory condition, there shall be no fee for the
new meter. The meter fee shall be partially refunded if the service is
permanently disconnected, or is enlarged, and the meter is returned to
the Waterworks in satisfactory condition. Such refund shall be equal to
the fee originally paid, less 10% for each year or fraction of a year since
its installation. If a larger meter is installed because it is necessitated
by an order of the Director of Water to install a backflow preventer
pursuant to § 23-27, and if the old meter is returned to the Waterworks
in satisfactory condition, then the property owner shall be credited with
the full amount of the fee, at current prices, for the old meter. When the
water supply through a service is discontinued but the service is not
permanently disconnected from the main, the meter will be stored by
the Waterworks until it is reinstalled in the service at the request of the
owner. No refund of the meter fee shall be made when the meter is
removed for storage, and no meter fee shall be charged when it is
reinstalled. [Amended 3-9-1982 by Ord. No. 82-105; 9-16-2008 by

may require the meter to be housed in a vault outside the building but
inside the property line, instead of inside the building. Where the Director
deems that a meter will not be safe and secure if it is located within the
building or that access by a meter reader will be difficult, he or she may
require the meter to be installed in a meter vault. Plans for meter vault
construction shall be submitted to the Director for his or her approval prior
to construction. Vaults shall be constructed and maintained by and at the
expense of the property owner.
§ 23-11. Meter bypass. [Amended 2-14-2006 by Ord. No. 2006-22;

submitted to the Director for his or her approval, prior to installation. The
Director may require a meter to be installed in the bypass by and at the
expense of the property owner. Every unmetered bypass line outside a vault
shall have a lockable valve box which shall be sealed closed and opened only
by the Waterworks. No connections shall be made to the bypass.
§ 23-12. Broken seals.
If a seal on a valve, meter or other fitting is broken, it shall be presumptive
evidence that the water consumption has not been properly registered on
the meter. If a seal is broken, it shall be resealed by the Waterworks,
and the property owner shall be charged a fee for resealing, pursuant to
§ 23-37F(1). No fee shall be charged if the seal was broken accidentally and
the Waterworks is notified promptly.
§ 23-13. Meter tests.
Upon request of a property owner or at the Waterworks' initiative, meters
may be tested by the Waterworks. The property owner may, if desired,
witness the test. The test results shall be presumptive evidence of whether
the meter is and has been functioning properly. If the test results indicate
accuracy within current American Water Works Association limits, the
owner shall be charged for the test, pursuant to § 23-37F(4), if the test was
done at the owner's request. If the test results do not meet American Water
Works Association accuracy limits, the meter shall be replaced at no charge
to the owner, there shall be no charge for the test and the most current
water bill shall be adjusted as necessary, either up or down, to compensate
for the meter error.

shall be based on metered consumption, as determined by periodic
meter readings taken by the Waterworks. The meter reading frequency
shall generally be either quarterly or monthly and shall be determined
by the Director of the Water Bureau based upon meter size. [Amended
1-11-1983 by Ord. No. 83-8]
C. Estimated bills. If a meter reader cannot gain access to the meter for a
scheduled reading, an estimated bill may be issued, based on past
metered consumption. Estimated bills may be escalated by up to 10%
beyond past consumption to reflect the possibility of leakage. If a valid
meter reading is obtained subsequent to the issuance of an estimated
bill, the original amount of the estimated bill shall be adjusted as
necessary to reflect actual consumption. No adjustment shall be made
to any late charges which have accrued against the original estimated
bill. If no subsequent valid meter reading is obtained, the estimated
bills, including all late charges, shall stand as originally issued.

property against which it accrued as of the accrual date. The amount of
the late payment charge shall be equal to 3% of the delinquent balance
for charges which are billed quarterly and 1% of the delinquent balance
for charges which are billed monthly, which interest shall be
compounded. [Amended 6-4-1985 by Ord. No. 85-234; 4-24-2012

inch. If the attempt is not successful, the City shall have no
responsibility to make any other or further efforts to thaw the service,
and no charge shall be made. If the attempt is successful, a fee
pursuant to § 23-37F(2) shall be charged, and the occupant of the
premises will be encouraged to maintain a constant flow of water
through the service to prevent refreezing. To compensate for the
additional water consumed thereby, the metered consumption on the
next succeeding water bill for the premises shall be reduced by 7,000
gallons.
B. Refreezing. If the service refreezes within seven days of being thawed
by the Waterworks and if the owner or occupant requests the
Waterworks to thaw it again, another attempt shall be made, as
provided above, to thaw the service. However, the owner shall lose the
right to a water bill reduction as authorized above, and, if the attempt is
successful, a higher fee shall be charged, pursuant to § 23-37F(2). If the
attempt is not successful, no fee shall be charged.
C. Liability. The City shall bear no liability for defects in the water service
prior to or resulting from its freezing, unless the defects were caused
directly by the actions of the City.
A. Building demolition. When any person obtains a permit from the
Commissioner of Neighborhood and Business Development, pursuant
to § 39-207 of the City Code for the demolition of a building, that person
shall be required to pay, in addition to any other fees charged by the
Department of Neighborhood and Business Development, a water
service disconnection fee, pursuant to § 23-37F(5), covering the
Waterworks' cost of permanently disconnecting the water service from
the street main. [Amended 6-27-1985 by Ord. No. 85-263;
6-16-2009 by Ord. No. 2009-179]
B. Replacement of existing service. If a property owner requests a new or
enlarged water service, any old service or services which will not be
used must be permanently disconnected at the water main. The
permanent disconnection of any such service shall be performed by the
Waterworks after payment of a service disconnection fee by the
property owner, pursuant to § 23-37F. However, in certain instances
when the new tap is within three feet of the old tap, and upon approval
of the Director of Water and inspection by the Waterworks, the work
required to permanently disconnect such service may be performed by
a plumber. All costs for permits and necessary street or sidewalk
restoration shall be borne by the property owner. [Amended 6-4-1985
by Ord. No. 85-234; 9-16-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-334277]

served by a single water service pipe, provided that the Director of
Water determines that installation of separate services is not feasible
and provided that the owners of all units served by such pipe, either
individually or by an association representing them, agree to guarantee
payment of all water charges which accrue against all units.
B. Single meter. If the service has a single meter, then a single water bill
shall be issued. Any delinquent charges shall be a lien on all units.
C. Multiple meters. If the service has multiple meters serving each of the
separately owned units, then a separate bill shall be issued for each
unit. Delinquent charges shall be a lien only on the unit to which they
were billed.
D. Responsibilities of unit owners. All unit owners, either individually or by
an association representing them, shall be responsible for the
obligations placed on property owners by this chapter. Whether owned
by the City or by the unit owners, the service pipe shall be installed and
maintained at the expense of the unit owners, except for maintenance
between the connection with the main and the curb valve, inclusive,
which shall be provided by the City at no charge.
E. Specifications. The water service and meters shall be installed in
accordance with any special requirements imposed by the Director of
Water in the water specifications.
A. Backflow prevention device. The Waterworks may at any reasonable
time inspect any parcel in order to determine if a hazard exists due to
an actual or potential cross-connection between the water system and
any potential source of contamination. In any case where the Director
of Water deems such hazard to exist, he or she may require the property
owner to install an approved backflow prevention service in every water
service line to the parcel for which a potential hazard exists. Such
devices shall be installed at or as near the service connection as may be
required by the Director of Water. Such backflow preventers shall be
designed and installed in accordance with all regulations of Part 5,
1.31, of the New York State Sanitary Code and must be approved by the
Director and the New York State Health Department prior to
installation. All costs of installation and maintenance shall be borne by

E. Restrictive covenant agreements. The Mayor is authorized to enter into
restrictive covenant agreements with various commercial and
industrial facilities regarding the installation of backflow prevention
devices on their real property. These agreements shall allow backflow
prevention devices to be installed in a main building with a meter at the
property line as long as there are no taps between the meter and the
main building, while requiring that if a tap is installed between the
meter and the main building, then backflow prevention devices must be
removed to the property line. These agreements shall be binding on all
successors to the property and may be dischargeable by the Mayor
whenever such backflow prevention devices are no longer required by
law or ordinance for said property. The agreements shall contain such
additional terms and conditions as the Mayor deems to be appropriate.

A. Hydrant use permit. An application may be made to the Director of
Water for a permit to take water from a fire hydrant of the City. If such a
permit is granted, an extension nozzle, meter, wrench, reduced
pressure zone backflow prevention device and appropriate fittings will
be provided by the Waterworks to the applicant, and all water taken
from the hydrant shall be taken through such nozzle, meter and
reduced pressure zone backflow prevention device. The nozzle, wrench,
meter fittings and reduced pressure zone backflow prevention device
shall be returned to the Waterworks upon or before expiration of the
permit. Hydrant permits may be issued for one month or the expected
duration of the project and must be prepaid. Renewals must be prepaid.
The applicant is responsible for properly supporting the meter-backflow
assembly from the ground. The applicant is responsible for properly
protecting the assembly. Hydrant permits will be issued only for
domestic hydrants. All high-pressure Holly hydrants (painted with
white dome) will not be used. The applicant will be expected to call at
least 24 business hours in advance of obtaining the permit with the
required nozzle size and hydrant location, to give the Water Bureau
time to unlock the hydrant and prepare the assembly. If the applicant
needs to move the assembly to another hydrant, he will be expected to
call Dispatch (585-428-7500) at least 24 hours in advance to give the
Water Bureau time to unlock the next hydrant. The applicant will be
expected to follow all written instructions issued with the permit. No
hydrant permit will be issued for any use which the Director deems to
be a potential hazard or nuisance. [Amended 9-2-1986 by Ord. No.
86-292; 6-17-2014 by Ord. No. 2014-184]
B. Charges. A monthly fee shall be charged for each hydrant permit
pursuant to § 23-37E(1) and (2), and a refundable deposit shall be
required pursuant to § 23-37E(3) for each nozzle, wrench, meter and
reduced pressure zone backflow prevention device taken. In addition,
the applicant shall pay either the minimum hydrant water consumption
charge pursuant to § 23-37E(2) or a metered water consumption charge
at the regular metered consumption rates set forth in § 23-37A(1), at
the discretion of the Director. If the Director requires the payment of
metered consumption charges, a meter will be supplied to the applicant
by the Waterworks, and the applicant shall make a refundable deposit
for the meter at the rates set forth in § 23-37B. The applicant will also
be charged the cost of any repairs or replacements necessitated by
such use of the hydrant, nozzle, wrench, meter and reduced pressure
zone backflow prevention device. The costs will include water main
repair, hydrant repair, road restoration and other damages caused by
the rapid opening or closing of the valving or hydrant, known as "water
hammer." Water hammer will cause excessive flow and pressure
variations that may break the water mains. Hydrant permits issued to
contractors for demolition are permitted to use their own backflow
device, without a meter. The Permit Office will charge the normal fees
for hydrant use and minimum monthly consumption charge, as a part of
the abandonment permit. [Amended 9-2-1986 by Ord. No. 86-292;

clearly distinguish them from City hydrants. All private Holly hydrants
shall have the barrel painted red and the bonnet painted white to
prevent cross-connection. All unmetered private fire hydrants must
have locks supplied and installed by the Waterworks. Fees will be paid
pursuant to § 23-37E(5)(a) and (b). All unmetered private fire hydrants
shall be billed a quarterly fire service charge pursuant to § 23-37C. The
charge shall be based-upon the size of the service pipe in lieu of the
check valve size. Private fire hydrants shall be used only for fire-fighting
purposes. [Added 6-4-1985 by Ord. No. 85-234; amended
9-16-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-334282]

not been properly registered on a meter. No person shall take or accept
water without paying for it. [Amended 6-4-1985 by Ord. No. 85-234]
B. Presumptions. If a bypass valve has been opened or if the meter has
been removed or tampered with or if some other condition is found to
exist in a water service which would permit the delivery of water to the
premises without the proper registry thereof on a meter, it shall be
presumptive evidence that the person or persons who accepted or
received the use or benefit of the water did so with knowledge of the
illegal condition.

Chapter 27
ALARM SYSTEMS AND BUSINESSES
GENERAL REFERENCES
Municipal Code Violations Bureau  See Ch.
13A.
§ 27-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known as the "Alarm Systems Ordinance."
§ 27-2. Purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to protect and promote the health, safety
and general welfare of the residents of the City of Rochester by reducing
the number of avoidable alarms to emergency agencies. Avoidable alarms
contribute to ineffective utilization of public safety manpower and
equipment. In addition, avoidable alarms require emergency responses
which may contribute to a high accident rate and delayed responses to
genuine emergencies. This chapter seeks to ensure that police, ambulance
and fire communications facilities will be available to dispatch police,
ambulance and fire personnel for actual emergencies and to alleviate the
nuisance of audible alarms to the surrounding community. Another purpose
of this chapter is to provide the City with the names of responsible people
to contact in the case of activation of an alarm.
§ 27-3. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ALARM BUSINESS  Any person who engages in the business of selling,
altering, installing, leasing, maintaining, repairing, replacing, servicing or
responding to an alarm system.
ALARM SYSTEM  A device or an assembly of equipment which emits
an audible response which is intended to alert persons outside a premises
to the existence of a hazard or emergency, or which is intended to alert
emergency agencies by automatically dialing an emergency agency, or
which is connected to a private answering point for the purpose of reporting
such alarms to emergency agencies, or which is directly connected to the
Emergency Communications Center or other emergency agency.
ALARM USER  Any person who owns, leases or uses an alarm system
within the City of Rochester, except for a person whose alarm system is on a
motor vehicle or is a proprietary system. If, however, an alarm system on a
§ 23-37 (RESERVED) § 27-3
22:625
motor vehicle is connected with an alarm system at a premises (other than
a proprietary system) in the City of Rochester, the person using such system
is an "alarm user."
AVOIDABLE ALARM  The activation of an alarm system through
mechanical failure, malfunction, improper installation or the negligence
of the owner, user, custodian or lessee of an alarm system or of his or
her employees or agents or through any other cause which through direct
connection to an emergency agency or which through notification of an
emergency agency by a private answering point or automatic dialing device
or which through notification to an emergency agency by any other second
party or means indicates that an emergency situation exists requiring an
emergency response within the City of Rochester when, in fact, an
emergency situation does not exist. An "avoidable alarm" also includes the
knowing or intentional activation of an alarm to an emergency agency when
the activator knows that an emergency situation does not exist. "Avoidable
alarm" does not include alarms activated by violent conditions of nature,
such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes or any other similar cause
beyond the control of the user of an alarm system. Activation of an alarm
system under any circumstances in which the activator reasonably believes
that an emergency situation exists is not an "avoidable alarm."[Amended
2-14-2006 by Ord. No. 2006-22]
EMERGENCY AGENCY  Any police department, fire department or other
law enforcement agency, ambulance company or other agency summoned
to respond to an emergency situation; and the Emergency Communications
Center.
LOCAL ALARM SYSTEM  A signaling system which, when activated,
causes an audible signaling device to be activated outside the premises
within which the system is installed.
PRIVATE ANSWERING POINT  A business which offers the service of
receiving emergency signals, monitoring said signals and relaying them to
an emergency agency.
PROPRIETARY SYSTEM  An alarm, sounding and/or recording alarm
and supervisory signals at a control center located within the premises
protected by the alarm, which is not intended to alert persons outside of the
premises on which the alarm system is located of a possible hazard and is
not intended to alert an emergency agency, the control center being under
the supervision of the proprietor of the protected premises. If a proprietary
system includes a signal line connected directly or by means of an automatic
dialing device to an emergency agency or to a private answering point or
to a local alarm system, it thereby becomes an "alarm system" as defined in
this chapter.
§ 27-4. Exemptions.
The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to proprietary alarm systems.
Permits shall be required for alarm systems located in buildings of federal,
state or local governmental agencies or authorities or in public elementary
§ 27-3 ROCHESTER CODE § 27-4
22:626
or secondary schools, and said alarm systems shall meet the other
requirements of this chapter, but said alarm systems shall be exempt from
all fees established in this chapter.
§ 27-5. Alarm user permits; fees.
A. No person shall own, use, lease, operate or maintain an alarm system
within the City of Rochester unless such person shall have first obtained
from the City a permit for such alarm.
B. Alarm user permit application.
(1) In order to obtain an alarm user permit, any person who operates
an alarm system shall submit an application for such permit in the
form designated by the City, which application shall contain the
following information:
(a) The name and home address of the person applying for a
permit.
(b) The address of the premises upon which the alarm system is or
will be located.
(c) The type of alarm system for which the permit is sought.
(d) The name of the alarm business or businesses selling,
installing, monitoring, inspecting, responding to and/or
maintaining the alarm system, if applicable.
(e) The telephone number of the person applying for the permit.
(f) The name and telephone number of at least two other persons
who can be reached at any time, day or night, and who are
authorized by the owner of the premises in which the system is
installed to open the premises. This requirement may be
waived by the City for residential owners if it will result in a
hardship or for a good cause shown.
(g) Any other information as the City may require.
(2) The information required on the permit application shall be treated
as confidential and shall not be made available to members of the
general public. The Council finds that the release of such
information would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal
privacy and could endanger the life or safety of persons at the
premises where an alarm system is located. The information on a
permit application shall be used by the City only for law
enforcement purposes.
(3) Every application for an alarm user permit shall be accompanied by
a fee of $25. No alarm user permit shall be granted unless the
applicable fee is submitted with the application. [Amended
10-13-1992 by Ord. No. 92-379; 6-18-2002 by Ord. No.

(4) Upon receipt of a properly executed application, the City shall issue
an alarm user permit to the applicant. Alarm user permits shall not
be transferable and shall be maintained on the premises where the
alarm system is located and made available for inspection by
emergency agency officers.
C. Duration of permit.
(1) An alarm user permit shall expire on April 30 next following its
issuance.
(2) An alarm user permit shall be revoked whenever 25 or more
avoidable alarms are recorded for a system in any one permit year.
Notice of such revocation shall be sent by the City, by first-class
mail, to the home address listed on the permit application at least
10 days before the revocation takes effect. The alarm user may
reinstate a revoked permit by payment of all excessive use fees and
by submission of proof that modifications have been made to the
alarm system to reduce the number of avoidable alarms. The alarm
user may seek administrative review of the revocation in
accordance with Subsection G hereof by notifying the Fire Chief or
Chief of Police, in writing, within 10 days after the date of the
notice of revocation. The failure to give timely notice shall be
deemed a waiver of the right to challenge the revocation. An alarm
user permit shall not be revoked under this subsection if said alarm
system is required by federal, state or local law, However, all other
provisions of this section shall apply to such systems, and the user
of such a system shall remain responsible for the payment of all
authorized fees. [Amended 4-15-1986 by Ord. No. 86-96]
D. Renewal of permit. Subject to the provisions of this chapter and upon
payment of the appropriate permit renewal fee, stipulated in
Subsection E hereof, an alarm user permit may be renewed by the
alarm user.
E. Renewal fees based on use.

avoidable alarms recorded for each alarm user as follows:

pull stations, or heat, smoke, flame or fire gas detectors, or
water flow sensing devices, not including sprinkler heads, until
the alarm user has had more than 20 avoidable alarms during

of the ticket and submits proof that a permit has been obtained to the
Municipal Code Violations Bureau prior to or at a scheduled hearing on
the ticket. Payment of the penalty established herein shall not satisfy the
requirement to obtain a permit or to pay the applicable permit fees.

for additional avoidable alarms. Such notice shall inform the alarm
user that additional avoidable alarms will subject the alarm user to
such excessive use fees. At the end of a permit year, the City shall

the home address listed on the permit application, of the number of
avoidable alarms incurred during the preceding year and the amount to

Departments to collect such evidence and make a recommendation and
findings of fact concerning such classification. The Chief of Police or the
Fire Chief shall make the final determination concerning the
classification, which determination shall be reviewable only pursuant to
Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules. In order to challenge the
classification of an alarm as an avoidable alarm, an alarm user must so
notify the Chief of Police or Fire Chief, in writing, within 10 days after
the date of the notification to the alarm user of the avoidable alarms
incurred during the preceding period, except that the first three
avoidable alarms may only be challenged within 10 days of an alarm
user being notified on a fourth avoidable alarm during a permit year.
The failure to give timely notice shall be deemed a waiver of the right to
challenge the classification. [Amended 4-15-1986 by Ord. No.

(1) The Council recognizes that the City and its surrounding area have
a large incidence of sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS.
The Council wishes to assure that entertainment centers are not
used in a manner that can facilitate the transmission of such
311. Editor's Note: This ordinance provided that it would take effect on 2-1-1996 and would
apply to all establishments doing business on or after said date.

diseases through high-risk sexual contact with multiple partners.
The Council has reviewed information justifying the enactment
of ordinances in other municipalities establishing open booth
requirements and believes that such justifications apply in the City
of Rochester. As a result of reviewing information and ordinances
from other municipalities and information on local entertainment
centers, the Council finds that:
(a) Large numbers of persons, primarily male, frequent adult
entertainment establishments and other establishments which
provide closed booths for the private viewing of motion
pictures and adult entertainment; [Amended 11-19-2002 by
Ord. No. 2002-354]
(b) Such closed booths have been used by patrons for the purpose
of engaging in sexual acts and certain booths in the City have
been constructed so as to facilitate sexual activity;
(c) Doors, curtains, partitions, drapes or other obstructions in the
entrances to such booths encourage patrons using such booths
to engage in sexual acts therein, thereby promoting and
encouraging prostitution and the commission of sexual acts
which may lead to the transmission of disease between such
persons or the deposit of bodily fluids on the floors and walls of
such booths. Such activities could also prove detrimental to the
health and safety of other persons who may come into contact
with such fluids; and
(d) The reasonable regulation and supervision of such adult
entertainment establishments and such booths tends to
discourage such sexual acts and prostitution.
(2) No person shall own, operate, manage or control or cause or permit
the establishment, operation or use of a booth provided or used for
the private viewing of motion pictures or adult entertainment
unless the booth is physically constructed and arranged in such a
manner that the entire interior portion of the booth is clearly visible
to persons in an adjacent public area of the premises. Visibility into
such booths shall not be blocked or obscured by doors, curtains,
partitions, drapes or any other obstruction whatsoever. Such
booths shall be lighted in a manner that the persons in the booths
are visible to persons in an adjacent public area of the premises,
but such lighting shall not be of such intensity as to prevent the
viewing of the motion pictures or adult entertainment. All such
booths shall be separated from adjacent booths and any nonpublic
areas by a wall. All such walls shall be solid and without any
openings, shall extend from the floor to a height of not less than six
feet and shall be light colored, nonabsorbent, smooth-textured and
easily cleanable. Windows may be provided in the walls for viewing
live entertainment as long as the windows are solid and cannot be
opened to allow for contact between the patron and entertainer.

The floor in such booths shall also be nonabsorbent, smoothtextured

(3) No person shall allow or permit the use of a booth provided or used
for the private viewing of motion pictures or adult entertainment to
be occupied by more than one person at a time, nor shall more than
one person occupy any such booth at a time.

A. The City of Rochester is experiencing a significant overpopulation of
unwanted cats. These are matters of serious concern affecting public
health, safety, quality of life, and welfare of the public and of their pets.
Animal Services, which operates the City's animal shelter within the
Rochester Police Department, estimates that over 5,500 unwanted,
stray, or abandoned dogs and cats entered its facility during the
2005-2006 fiscal year. Of these, approximately 90% were not spayed
and neutered. While wandering the City's streets, nonsterilized cats
reproduce at alarming rates, exacerbating a potentially unhealthy and
dangerous situation. As a result of the exponential rate of increase,
increasing numbers of individuals and animals are at risk for rabies and
many animals become victims of vehicular accidents. These animals
also suffer from lack of appropriate food and water, ingestion of
poisons, exposure to inclement weather, and infestation with parasites.
Furthermore, it is well documented that sterilization helps to improve

§ 30-43. Definitions. [Added 12-19-2006 by Ord. No. 2006-391]
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
FARM ANIMAL  Any ungulate, poultry, species of cattle, sheep, swine,
goats, llamas, horses or fur-bearing animals, as defined in § 11-1907 of
the Environmental Conservation Law, which are raised for commercial or
subsistence purposes. "Fur-bearing animal" shall not include dogs or
cats.[Added 5-21-2019 by Ord. No. 2019-139]
FERAL CAT  Any free-roaming domestic cat which is not owned, lives in
the wild and is not socialized with humans.
OWNER  Any person owning, harboring or keeping, or providing care or
sustenance for a pet, whether registered or not, or having custody of a pet,
whether temporarily or permanently. Pets owned by minors shall be deemed
health and longevity and to reduce roaming tendencies and undesirable
behaviors, all of which impact cat intakes at shelters. Given the large
and growing number of unwanted cats and the benefits of sterilization
that address the challenges of cat control, Animal Services finds that a
law providing for the spaying and neutering of cats adopted from the
City's shelter is necessary to protect the health, safety, and quality of
life of Rochester residents and the welfare of the City's pet community.
Animal Services also finds that with the advancement of medical
knowledge over the past 15 years, many veterinarians now advocate
and practice early sterilization of pets, as early as eight weeks of
age. Veterinarians at animal hospitals and humane shelters across the
country, as well as the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals, have performed thousands of early spay-neuter surgeries.
Many veterinary associations now also agree that even though any
surgery has inherent risks, kittens heal faster and are lower surgical
risks than older animals who may be ill, in heat, or pregnant. If cats are
spayed or neutered before adoption from the shelter, then the chance
that they will add more unwanted offspring to the numbers that already
exist will be eliminated.
B. The Animal Services Center shall not release a cat to a person adopting
such cat unless such cat has been sterilized by a licensed veterinarian;
provided, however, that such requirement shall not apply if a licensed
veterinarian certifies to Animal Services that he or she has examined
such cat and found that because of a medical contraindication, the life
of such cat would be endangered by sterilization; provided, however,
that such reason shall not be based solely on the age of such cat, if such
cat is at least eight weeks of age. Prior to releasing a nonsterilized cat
to a person claiming ownership thereof, the Animal Services Center
may offer to have the cat sterilized by a licensed veterinarian for a fee
established by the Chief of Police pursuant to § 30-41; provided,
however, that the owner shall not be required to accept the offer in
order to redeem the cat.

to be in the custody and control of the minor's parents or other head of
household where the minor resides.
PET  Any cat, other than a feral cat, or any other domesticated animal
normally maintained in or near the household of the owner or person
who cares for such other domesticated animal. "Pet" shall not include a
"farm animal" as defined in this section.[Amended 5-21-2019 by Ord. No.

STERILIZATION  Rendering a cat that is at least eight weeks of age
unable to reproduce by surgically altering the cat's reproductive organs.
Such definition shall include the spaying of a female cat and the neutering
of a male cat.

pursuant to authorization contained in § 30-41.

All dogs in the City of Rochester are hereby required to be restrained
by a leash while off the owner's premises, whether such dogs are or are
not tagged or licensed; provided, however, that dogs are permitted to be
unleashed while off the owner's premises when on the premises of another
person with such other person's consent; and no person who owns, keeps,
harbors or has the care, custody or control of any dog in the City of
Rochester shall permit such dog to be at large or unleashed in said City
except as permitted by this chapter. Whenever a dog is outside the owner's
house on the owner's premises or on the premises of another with that
person's consent, such dog must be under the control of the owner, on a
leash or in a fenced area so that said dog cannot leave the premises. A
leash shall not extend beyond the premises onto other premises without
that property owner's consent or onto public property, or the dog will be
considered unleashed.
§ 31-5. Howling or barking dogs. [Amended 8-11-1998 by Ord. No.
98-341]
A. No person shall keep or harbor a dog which howls or barks in violation
of this section.
(1) It shall constitute a violation of this section if the howling or
barking occurs continually and is audible beyond the property line
of the premises on which the dog is located:
(a) For more than five minutes between the hours of 10:00 p.m.
and 8:00 a.m.;
(b) For more than 15 minutes between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and
10:00 p.m.; or
(c) For a shorter duration than cited above, but on more than five
occasions within a given ten-day period if attested to by
complainants from two or more separate properties.
(2) It shall be a defense to such violation if the owner of the dog proves
by a preponderance of the evidence that the only reason the dog
was howling or barking was that the dog was being provoked by a
person or was otherwise being incited, or was acting as a guide
dog, hearing dog, service dog or police work dog.
B. In order to abate the nuisance created by a dog howling or barking in
violation of this section, Dog Control Officers may enter the yard and
may seize any such dog from the yard where the violation is occurring if
the officer is unable to contact the owner or if the owner is unable or
unwilling to take action to stop the howling or barking.

A. No person shall own or harbor a dangerous dog, unless such dog is at
all times restrained and controlled so as to prevent the attack of or
injury to any person, companion animal, domestic animal or farm
animal, and so as to prevent such dog from putting any person in
reasonable fear of immediate bodily harm, provided that such person is
peaceably conducting himself or herself in a place where he or she may
lawfully be. [Amended 2-14-2006 by Ord. No. 2006-22; 7-19-2011
by Ord. No. 2011-264321]
B. When any person makes a complaint to the Animal Services Center
regarding a dangerous dog, a Dog Control Officer shall explain to the
complainant that a dangerous dog proceeding may be commenced
either in the Dog Complaint Division or in City Court. The Dog Control
Officer shall explain the procedures involved and possible penalties
available in each of these alternative forums. Initial complaints of a
dangerous dog which, in the opinion of the Dog Control Officer, do not
pose a serious threat to the health and safety of other persons,
companion animals, domestic animals or farm animals and which the
complainant does not wish to bring in City Court may be referred to the
Dog Complaint Division. For complaints referred to the Dog Complaint
Division, violators shall be subject to the penalties set forth in § 31-17 of
the Municipal Code. If a Dog Control Officer has reason to believe that a
dog may be vicious, the Dog Control Officer shall consider that said dog
poses a serious threat to health and safety and shall commence a
dangerous dog proceeding in City Court. Where the dog causes serious
physical injury to a person or where the owner has been found guilty
previously of a violation of § 31-4 and a dog owned or harbored by that
same individual bites a person or where the dog has been previously
found to be a dangerous dog and bites another person, the owner may
be charged in accordance with Subsection F. [Amended 1-16-2001 by
Ord. No. 2001-39; 7-19-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-264322]
C. Repeated complaints of a dangerous dog and all complaints of a
dangerous dog which pose a serious threat to the health and safety of
other persons, companion animals, domestic animals or farm animals
shall be referred to City Court for proceedings pursuant to § 123 of the
New York State Agriculture and Markets Law and consistent with this
section. In reviewing such complaints about dangerous dogs, the Court
may avail itself of the advice of veterinarians, dog trainers and/or the
Animal Control staff. [Amended 7-19-2011 by Ord. No. 2011-264323]

D. Upon finding a dog to be a dangerous dog, the Court may order the
immediate destruction of the dog or, in the alternative, may order any
or all of the following, for which failure to comply shall result in
destruction of the dog and shall constitute a violation of this section by
the owner:
(1) Monetary penalty. The Court may impose a penalty in an amount
not to exceed $1,000 upon any person found culpably negligent in
failing to restrain or control a dangerous dog. [Amended

(2) Leash. No person having charge, custody, control or possession of a
dangerous dog shall allow the dog to exit its kennel, pen or other
proper enclosure unless such dog is securely attached to a leash
not more than four feet in length. No such person shall permit a
dangerous dog to be kept on a chain, rope or other type of leash
outside its kennel or pen unless a person capable of controlling the
dog is in physical control of the leash.
(3) Muzzle. It shall be unlawful for any owner or keeper of a dangerous
dog to allow the dog to be outside of its proper enclosure unless it
is necessary for the dog to receive veterinary care or exercise. In
such cases, the dog shall wear a properly fitted muzzle to prevent it
from biting humans or other animals. Such muzzle shall not
interfere with the dog's breathing or vision.
(4) Confinement. Except when leashed and muzzled as provided in this
section, a dangerous dog shall be securely confined indoors or
confined in a locked pen or other secure enclosure that is suitable
to prevent the entry of children and is designed to prevent the dog
from escaping. The enclosure shall include shelter and protection
from the elements and shall provide adequate exercise room, light
and ventilation. The enclosed structure shall be kept in a clean and
sanitary condition and shall meet the following requirements:
(a) The structure must have secure sides and a secure top, or all
sides must be at least eight feet high;
(b) The structure must have a bottom permanently attached to the
sides or the sides must be embedded not less than one foot into
the ground; and
(c) The structure must be of such material and closed in such a
manner that the dog cannot exit the enclosure on its own.
(5) Indoor confinement. No dangerous dog shall be kept on a porch,
patio or in any part of a house or structure that would allow the dog
to exit such building on its own volition. In addition, no such dog
shall be kept in a house or structure when screen windows or

screen doors are the only obstacle preventing the dog from exiting
the structure.
(6) Signs. The owner of a dangerous dog shall post in a prominent
place on their premises a sign with lettering at least 2 1/2 inches
high and in a color contrasting to that of the background, stating
"Dangerous Dog on Premises."
(7) Liability insurance; surety bond. The owner of a dangerous dog
shall present to the Director of the Animal Services Center proof
that he or she has procured liability insurance or a surety bond in
the amount of not less than $100,000 covering any damage or
injury that may be caused by such dangerous dog. The policy shall
contain a provision requiring that the City be notified immediately
by the agent issuing the policy in the event that the insurance
policy is canceled, terminates or expires. The liability insurance or
surety bond shall be obtained prior to the redemption of a
dangerous dog. The dog owner shall sign a statement attesting that
he or she shall maintain and not voluntarily cancel the liability
insurance policy unless he or she ceases to own or keep the dog.
[Amended 12-19-2006 by Ord. No. 2006-390]
(8) Notification of escape. The owner of a dangerous dog shall notify
the Director of the Animal Services Center immediately if such dog
escapes from its enclosure or restraint and is at large. Such
immediate notification shall also be required if the dog bites or
attacks a person or domestic animal. [Amended 12-19-2006 by
Ord. No. 2006-390]
(9) Consultation with a behaviorist. The owner of a dangerous dog
shall, at the owner's expense, consult a Behaviorist accredited by
the Animal Behavior Society, or a veterinarian who specializes in
behavior, and follow said professional's instructions.
(10) Obedience training. The owner of a dangerous dog shall, at the
owner's expense, contact an obedience trainer for instruction and
shall follow the trainer's recommendation.
(11) Neutering. The owner of a dangerous dog shall, at the owner's
expense, have the dog spayed or neutered to prevent the potential
reproduction of similarly dangerous dogs.
(12) Marking or implanting identification. The Court shall require that
all dangerous dogs be marked or implanted with an individual
means of identification, in a form deemed most appropriate by
Animal Control Services, if the immediate destruction of the dog is
not ordered. This shall occur prior to the release of the dog from
the Animal Services Center and shall be at the expense of the
owner. [Added 1-16-2001 by Ord. No. 2001-39; amended

(13) Payment of medical costs. The Court shall require the owner of a
dangerous dog to pay restitution for the medical costs resulting
from injury caused by such dog to a person, companion animal,
domestic animal or farm animal. [Added 7-19-2011 by Ord. No.
2011-264324]
E. In addition to Subsection D above, upon finding a dog to be a dangerous
dog, whether or not the immediate destruction of the dog is ordered,
the Court shall order the owner to attend and successfully complete, at
the owners expense, a class on dog ownership and responsibility as
approved by the Animal Control Services. Failure to comply shall result
in destruction of the dog and/or shall constitute a violation of this
section by the owner and/or a contempt of court. [Added 1-16-2001 by
Ord. No. 2001-39325]
F. Physical injury. [Added 1-16-2001 by Ord. No. 2001-39]

§ 31-4 and who owns or harbors a dog shall suffer or permit the dog
to cause physical injury to another person.
(3) No person who owns or harbors a dog that has been previously
found to be a dangerous dog shall suffer or permit the dog to cause
physical injury to another person.
(4) For purposes of Subsection F(1), (2) and (3) above, the owner or
harborer of a dog which causes serious physical injury or physical
injury to another person shall be deemed to have suffered or
permitted such dog to cause the injury by failure to properly leash,
secure or control said dog.
(5) Notwithstanding the penalties established elsewhere in this Code,
a person who violates this Subsection F shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor for which the penalty shall be a fine not to exceed
$1,000 and/or imprisonment for a term not to exceed one year.
G. The owner of any premises patrolled by a guard dog shall post a sign at
each point of public access with lettering in clear and concise English at

A. The City of Rochester is experiencing a host of challenges related to
stray and roaming dogs. These are matters of serious concern affecting
public health, safety, quality of life, and welfare of the public and of
their pets. Animal Services, which operates the City's animal shelter
within the Rochester Police Department, estimates that over 5,500
unwanted, stray, or abandoned dogs and cats entered its facility during
the 2005-2006 fiscal year. Of these, approximately 90% were not spayed
and neutered. While wandering the City's streets, nonsterilized dogs
reproduce at alarming rates, exacerbating a potentially unhealthy and
dangerous situation. As a result of the exponential rate of increase,
increasing numbers of individuals and animals are at risk for rabies and
many animals become victims of vehicular accidents. These animals

§ 31-23. Sterilization services. [Added 12-23-2008 by Ord. No.
2008-429]
In accordance with § 117 of the Agriculture and Markets Law, the Animal
Services Center shall provide services for the alteration of the reproductive
capacity through spaying or neutering of dogs owned by the residents of the
City. The fees for such services shall be established by the Chief of Police
pursuant to authorization contained in § 31-20.
Chapter 32
also suffer from lack of appropriate food and water, ingestion of
poisons, exposure to inclement weather, and infestation with parasites.
Additionally, dogs, are being intentionally bred irresponsibly
throughout the City with little regard for health or temperament of
the breeding pair and the resulting offspring. Furthermore, it is well
documented that sterilization helps to improve health and longevity
and to reduce roaming tendencies, undesirable behaviors, and possibly
dominance aggression, all of which impact dog intakes at shelters.
Given the benefits of sterilization that address the challenges of dog
control, Animal Services finds that a law providing for the spaying
and neutering of dogs adopted or redeemed from the City's shelter is
necessary to protect the health, safety, and quality of life of Rochester
residents and the welfare of the City's pet community. Animal Services
also finds that with the advancement of medical knowledge over the
past 15 years, many veterinarians now advocate and practice early
sterilization of pets, as early as eight weeks of age. Veterinarians at
animal hospitals and humane shelters across the country, as well as
the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, have
performed thousands of early spay-neuter surgeries. Many veterinary
associations now also agree that even though any surgery has inherent
risks, puppies heal faster and are lower surgical risks than older
animals who may be ill, in heat, or pregnant. If dogs are spayed or
neutered before adoption or redemption from the shelter, then the
chance that they will add more unwanted offspring to the numbers that
already exist will be eliminated.
B. The Animal Services Center shall not release a dog to a person adopting
such dog unless such dog has been sterilized by a licensed veterinarian;
provided, however, that such requirement shall not apply if a licensed
veterinarian certifies to Animal Services that he or she has examined
such dog and found that because of a medical contraindication, the life
of such dog would be endangered by sterilization; provided however,
that such reason shall not be based solely on the age of such dog, if such
dog is at least eight weeks of age. Prior to releasing a nonsterilized dog
to a person claiming ownership thereof, the Animal Services Center
shall offer to have the dog sterilized by a licensed veterinarian for a fee
established by the Chief of Police pursuant to § 31-20; provided,
however, that the owner shall not be required to accept the offer in
order to redeem the dog.

PART I
Site Preparation
§ 39-400. Purpose; objectives.
A. Land disturbance activities and associated increases in impervious
cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase
stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion,
and sediment transport and deposition. This stormwater runoff
contributes to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants.
Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from development sites.
B. During the construction process, soil is the most vulnerable to erosion
by wind and water. This eroded soil endangers water resources by
reducing water quality and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for
fish and other desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates
maintenance and/or repair of sewers and ditches and the dredging of
waterways. In addition, clearing and/or grading during construction
tends to increase soil erosion and causes the loss of native vegetation
necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat and to provide a healthy
living environment for citizens of the City of Rochester. Improper
design and construction of stormwater management practices can
increase the velocity of stormwater runoff, thereby increasing stream
bank erosion and sedimentation. Impervious surfaces allow less water
to percolate into the soil, thereby decreasing groundwater recharge
and stream base flow. Regulation of land disturbance activities by
means of performance standards governing stormwater management
and site design will produce development compatible with the natural
functions of a particular site or an entire watershed and thereby
mitigate the adverse effects of erosion and sedimentation from
development.
C. As a result, the purpose of this Part is to safeguard public health,
protect property, prevent damage to the environment and promote the
public welfare by guiding, regulating, and controlling the design,
construction, use, and maintenance of any development or other
activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the movement

These regulations shall be known and may be cited as the "Regulations for
the Issuance of Site Preparation Permits in the City of Rochester."
§ 39-402. Jurisdiction.
All site preparation and associated activities requiring a site preparation
permit shall be in conformance with the provisions set forth herein.
§ 39-403. Authority.
The Commissioner of Neighborhood and Business Development or his or
her legal representative shall be the authority having jurisdiction for the
purpose of administering these regulations. The City Engineer shall be the
legal representative of the Commissioner for the purposes of site work
within the right-of-way.
of earth on land in the City of Rochester. It seeks to meet those
purposes by achieving the following objectives:
(1) Require land disturbance activities to conform to the substantive
requirements of the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(SPDES) general permit for construction activities or as amended
or revised;
(2) Meet the requirements of minimum measures 4 and 5 of the SPDES
general permit for stormwater discharges from municipal separate
stormwater sewer systems (MS4s), Permit No. GP-02-02 or as
amended or revised;
(3) Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from land disturbance
activities in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream
temperature, and stream bank erosion and maintain the integrity of
stream channels;
(4) Minimize increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from
land disturbance activities which would otherwise degrade local
water quality;
(5) Minimize the total annual volume of stormwater runoff which flows
from any specific site during and following development to the
maximum extent practicable; and
(6) Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and
nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater
management practices and to ensure that these management
practices are properly maintained and eliminate threats to public
safety.

A. A certificate of substantial compliance shall be issued by the Director
when all of the following have been submitted to the Director or verified
as specified elsewhere in these regulations, including:
(1) Written verification from a New York State licensed professional
land surveyor, civil engineer or landscape architect that the final
grading and contours conform with the requirements of the
approved site plan.
(2) Required tests verifying soil compaction have been prepared by an
independent soils testing lab and copies of the results have been
submitted.
(3) Submission of the results of core samples taken from the site,
which verifies that the material deposited on site complies with
§ 39-408A(7). Core sampling shall be performed by an approved
independent testing laboratory and shall be taken at intervals not
to exceed one sample for each 5,000 square feet of site area
affected by any filling, grading or stripping operation covered by
these regulations. The exact locations of the samples shall be
determined by the Director.
B. Duration, maintenance and closeout when a SWPPP is required.
(1) Duration.
(a) For a project that requires an NYSDEC SPDES permit, the
SWPPP approved by the City of Rochester shall be in effect
until the site has been finally stabilized, a notice of termination
(NOT) is submitted to NYSDEC in accordance with the general
permit and a final inspection has been completed by the City of
Rochester.
§ 39-412 ROCHESTER CODE § 39-413
38:756
(b) For projects that do not require an NYSDEC NOT, the SWPPP is
in effect until a final inspection is conducted and the City of
Rochester has issued the applicant written approval.
(2) Maintenance.
(a) The applicant shall at all times properly operate and maintain
all stormwater management facilities and erosion and
sediment control measures which are installed or used by the
applicant to achieve compliance with the conditions of this
Part. Sediment shall be removed from sediment traps or
sediment ponds whenever their design capacity has been
reduced by 50%. The land disturbance activity shall not cause
an increase in turbidity that will result in substantial visible
contrast to natural conditions in surface waters of the State of
New York.
(b) At the end of the construction season when soil disturbance
activities will be finalized or suspended until the following
spring, it may be desirable to reduce the frequency of the
required weekly site inspections to monthly inspections. In
order to reduce inspection frequencies, the applicant must
complete stabilization activities before proper installation is
precluded by snow cover or frozen ground. If vegetation is
used as a stabilization method, seeding, planting, and/or
sodding must be scheduled to avoid fall frosts and to allow for
proper germination/establishment. Installations and
maintenance must be done according to the New York State
Standards and Specifications for Erosion and Sediment
Control.
(3) Closeout. The applicant must satisfy the following project closeout
requirements:
(a) Reestablish grade of all permanent stormwater facilities.
(b) Inspect grading of all drainage structures and provide
elevation as-builts to the City of Rochester.
(c) Establish perennial vegetative cover to a density of 80% over
100% of the site.
(d) Removal of all debris and temporary erosion and sediment
control practices.
(e) Provide a written certification by a New York State licensed/
certified professional that the site has undergone final
stabilization (as defined in § 39-404) and that all temporary

As used in this Part, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY  The activity of an active farm, including
grazing and watering livestock, irrigating crops, harvesting crops, using
land for growing agricultural products, and cutting timber for sale, but
shall not include the operation of a dude ranch or similar operation, or the

an application for a stormwater management permit.
CHANNEL  A natural or artificial watercourse with a definite bed and
banks that conducts continuously or periodically flowing water.
DEDICATION  The deliberate appropriation of property by its owner for
general public use.
A. Land development projects and associated increases in impervious
cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase
stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion,
and sediment transport and deposition. This stormwater runoff
contributes to increased quantities of waterborne pollutants.
Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from development sites.
B. The purpose of this Part is to establish minimum stormwater
management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the
general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in the
watersheds within the City of Rochester. Therefore, the City of
Rochester establishes this set of water quality and quantity policies to
provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of stormwater runoff
and to, in addition to the above, safeguard persons, protect property,
prevent damage to the environment in the City of Rochester, and
comply with the NYSDEC state pollutant discharge elimination system
(SPDES) general permit for stormwater discharges from municipal
separate storm sewer systems (MS4s), for the purpose of protecting
local water resources from degradation. It is determined that the
regulation of stormwaterrunoff discharges from land development
projects and other construction activities in order to control and
minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil
erosion, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution
associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will
prevent threats to public health and safety.

clearing, grading, excavating, soil disturbance or placement of fill, that
results in land disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre (43,560
square feet), or activities disturbing less than one acre (43,560 square feet)
of total land area that is part of a larger common plan of development or
sale, even though multiple separate and distinct land disturbance activities

commonly known as "hydrophytic vegetation."
§ 39-442. Applicability.
A. This Part shall be applicable to land disturbance activities, as defined in
§ 39-441, and those activities meeting Condition (1), (2), (3) or (4) below
shall include water quantity and water quality controls (postconstruction
stormwater runoff controls) as set forth in § 39-447 as
applicable unless eligible for an exemption or granted a waiver by the
City of Rochester in accordance with § 39-445:
(1) Stormwater runoff from land disturbance activities discharging a
pollutant of concern to either an impaired water identified on the
Department's 303(d) list of impaired waters or a total maximum
daily load (TMDL) designated watershed for which pollutants in
stormwater have been identified as a source of the impairment.
(2) Stormwater runoff from land disturbance activities disturbing five
or more acres.
(3) Stormwater runoff from land disturbance activity disturbing
between one acre and five acres of land during the course of the
project, exclusive of the construction of single-family residences
and construction activities at agricultural properties.
(4) Stormwater runoff from land disturbance activity that is smaller
than one acre disturbance if such activities are part of a larger
common plan of development, even though multiple separate and
distinct land disturbance activities may take place at different
times on different schedules.
B. All plans, documents and information required by this Part must be
reviewed by the Stormwater Management Officer to ensure that
established water quality standards will be maintained during and after
development of the site and that post-construction runoff levels are
consistent with any local and regional watershed plans.
C. When a site development plan is submitted that qualifies as a
redevelopment project, as defined in § 39-441, decisions on permitting
and on-site stormwater requirements shall be governed by special
stormwater sizing criteria found in the current New York State
Stormwater Management Design Manual. Final authorization of all
redevelopment projects will be determined after a review by the City of
Rochester. This applies to all redevelopment projects that are greater
than or equal to one acre (43,560 square feet).

38:762
§ 39-443. Compatibility with other permits and requirements.
§ 39-444. Compliance.
D. The following activities may be exempt from the requirements of this
Part:
(1) Any emergency activity which is immediately necessary for the
protection of life, property or natural resources.
(2) Agricultural activity as defined in this Part.
(3) Silvicultural activity, except that landing areas and log haul roads
are subject to this article.
(4) Routine maintenance activities that disturb less than five acres and
are performed to maintain the original line and grade, hydraulic
capacity or original purpose of a facility.
(5) Repairs to any stormwater treatment practice deemed necessary
by the City of Rochester.
A. This Part is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other
article, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law. The
requirements of this Part should be considered minimum requirements,
and where any provision of this Part imposes restrictions different from
those imposed by any other article, rule or regulation, or other
provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose
higher protective standards for human health and/or the environment
shall be considered to take precedence.
B. Construction activities that involve land disturbance may also require
additional compliance measures detailed in other regulations and/or
articles.
A. No person shall receive any of the building, grading or other land
disturbance approvals or permits required for land disturbance
activities without first meeting the requirements of this Part to the
satisfaction of the City of Rochester.
B. Unless specifically excluded by this Part, any landowner or operator
desiring approval or a permit for a land disturbance activity shall
comply with all applicable provisions of this Part and shall submit all
required plans, documentation and information as required under this
Part to the City of Rochester for review and approval.
C. Unless otherwise excepted by this Part, the following items shall be
submitted prior to the issuance of a permit or site plan approval:
(1) Stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) (see § 39-448).
(2) Maintenance easement(s) (see § 39-449).
§ 39-442 (RESERVED) § 39-444
38:763
§ 39-445. Waivers and mitigation requirements.
(3) Maintenance agreement(s) (see § 39-449).
(4) Any applicable fees.
(5) The SWPPP shall be prepared to meet the requirements of
§§ 39-447 through 39-449. The maintenance agreement shall be
prepared to meet the requirements of § 39-449.
(6) All documents required by this Part must be reviewed by the
Stormwater Management Officer to ensure that established water
quality standards will be maintained after development of the site
and that post-construction runoff levels are consistent with any
local and regional watershed plans. Information shall be submitted
as a single, logical package, with all information bound together.
A. All persons shall comply with the requirements of this Part, unless a
written request is filed to waive the requirements in part or whole for
land disturbance activities that disturb less than one acre of land.
Requests to waive any requirements of this Part shall be submitted to
the City of Rochester for approval.
B. The minimum requirements for stormwater management may be
waived in whole or in part upon written request of the applicant,
provided that at least one of the following conditions applies:
(1) It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely
to impair attainment of the objectives of this Part.
(2) Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of
stormwater discharges have been established in a stormwater
pollution prevention plan that has been approved by the City of
Rochester, and the implementation of the plan is required. These
practices are encouraged in order to minimize the reliance on
structural practices. Credit in the form of reductions in the amount
of stormwater that must be managed can be earned through the
use of nonstructural practices that reduce the generation of
stormwater from the site. These nonstructural practices are
explained in detail in the manual Better Site Design: A Handbook
for Changing Development Rules in Your Community. Applicants
wishing to obtain credit for use of nonstructural practices must
ensure that these practices are documented and remain unaltered
by subsequent property owners.
(3) Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site facility.
The off-site facility is required to be in place, to be designed and
adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater control that is
equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site
practices and there is a legally obligated entity responsible for
long-term operation and maintenance of the stormwater practice.
§ 39-444 ROCHESTER CODE § 39-445
38:764
(4) The City of Rochester finds that meeting the minimum on-site
management requirements is not feasible due to the natural or
existing physical characteristics of a site.
(5) Nonstructural practices will be used on the site that reduce:
(a) The generation of stormwater from the site;
(b) The size and cost of stormwater storage; and
(c) The pollutants generated at the site.
C. In instances where one of the conditions above applies, the City of
Rochester may grant a waiver from strict compliance with these
stormwater management provisions, as long as acceptable mitigation
measures are provided. However, to be eligible for a variance, the
applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City of Rochester
that the variance will not result in the following impacts to downstream
waterways:
(1) Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other
structures;
(2) Degradation of biological functions or habitat;
(3) Accelerated stream bank or streambed erosion or siltation;
(4) Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, property.
D. Furthermore, where compliance with minimum requirements for
stormwater management is waived, the applicant will satisfy the
minimum requirements by meeting one of the mitigation measures
selected by the City of Rochester. Mitigation measures may include, but
are not limited to, the following:
(1) The purchase and donation of privately owned lands, or the grant of
an easement to be dedicated for preservation and/or reforestation
(dedication or easement of land, see § 39-446B). These lands
should be located adjacent to the stream corridor in order to
provide permanent buffer areas to protect water quality and
aquatic habitat.
(2) The creation of a stormwater management facility or other
drainage improvements on previously developed properties, public
or private, that currently lack stormwater management facilities
designed and constructed in accordance with the purposes and
standards of this Part.
(3) Monetary contributions (fee in lieu of, see § 39-446A) to a dedicated
fund for stormwater management activities.
E. No waivers or mitigation plans will be considered for land disturbance
activity that disturbs one acre or greater of land.

38:765
§ 39-446. Fee in lieu of and dedication or easement of land.
§ 39-447. General design and performance criteria for stormwater
management.
A. Where the City of Rochester waives all or part of the minimum
stormwater management requirements, or where the waiver is based
on the provision of adequate stormwater facilities provided
downstream of the proposed development, the applicant shall be
required to pay a fee in an amount as determined by the City of
Rochester. All monetary contributions shall be made to a dedicated fund
for stormwater management activities. The fee structure shall be based
on the cubic feet of storage required for stormwater management of the
development in question. All of the monetary contributions shall be
made by the applicant prior to the issuance of any permit or approval
for the development.
B. In lieu of a monetary contribution, an applicant may obtain a waiver of
the required stormwater management by entering into an agreement
with the City of Rochester for the granting of an easement or the
dedication of land by the applicant, to be used for the construction of an
off-site stormwater management facility. The agreement shall be
entered into by the applicant and the City of Rochester prior to the
recording of plats or, if no record plat is required, prior to the issuance
of the permit.
A. The applicant shall consult the New York State Stormwater
Management Design Manual and the New York Standards and
Specifications for Erosion and Sediment Control for standards and
specifications related to stormwater management design criteria.
Stormwater management practices that are designed and constructed
in accordance with these technical documents shall be presumed to
meet the standards imposed by this law. If there is a conflict between
any of the standards, the more stringent standard shall apply. Where
stormwater management practices are not in accordance with technical
standards, the applicant or developer must demonstrate equivalence to
the technical standards set forth in this section and § 39-448, and the
SWPPP shall be prepared by a licensed professional.
B. The following design and performance criteria shall be addressed for
stormwater management at all sites:
(1) All site designs shall establish stormwater management practices
to control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharge associated
with specified design storms and reduce the generation of
stormwater. These practices should seek to utilize pervious areas
for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate stormwater runoff from
driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas
to the maximum extent practicable to provide treatment for both
water quality and quantity.

38:766
§ 39-448. Stormwater pollution prevention plan requirements.
(2) All stormwater runoff generated from new development shall not
discharge untreated stormwater directly into a jurisdictional
wetland or local water body without adequate treatment. Where
such discharges are proposed, the impact of the proposal on
wetland functional values shall be assessed using a method
acceptable to the City of Rochester. In no case shall the impact on
functional values be any greater than that allowed by the Army
Corps of Engineers (COE) or the NYSDEC responsible for natural
resources.
(3) An attempt shall be made to maintain annual groundwater
recharge rates, by promoting infiltration through the use of
structural and nonstructural methods. At a minimum, an attempt
shall be made for annual recharge from the post-development site
to mimic the annual recharge from pre-development site
conditions.
(4) In order to protect stream channels from degradation, a specific
channel protection criteria shall be provided as prescribed in the
New York State Stormwater Management Design Manual.
(5) Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources
may be subject to additional performance criteria or may need to
utilize or restrict certain stormwater management practices.
(6) Stormwater discharges from land uses or activities with higher
potential pollutant loadings, known as "hotspots," may require the
use of specific structural stormwater treatment practices and
pollution prevention practices.
(7) Prior to design, applicants are required to consult with the City of
Rochester to determine if they are subject to additional stormwater
design requirements.
(8) The calculations for determining peak flows (WQv), as found in the
New York State Stormwater Management Design Manual, shall be
used for sizing all stormwater management practices.
A. A SWPPP is required as part of the compliance with this Part. This plan
must be prepared by a qualified professional and must indicate whether
stormwater will be managed on site or off site and, if on site, the
general location and type of practices and shall also include sufficient
information (e.g., maps, hydrologic calculations, etc.) to evaluate the
environmental characteristics of the project site, the potential impacts
of all proposed development of the site, both present and future, on the
water resources, and the effectiveness and acceptability of the
measures proposed for managing stormwater generated at the project
site. The plan must be signed by a New York State licensed professional
engineer (PE), who will verify that the design of all stormwater
§ 39-447 (RESERVED) § 39-448
38:767
management practices meets the submittal requirements outlined in
the New York State Stormwater Management Design Manual. No
building or grading permit or site plan approval shall be issued until a
satisfactory stormwater pollution prevention plan, or a waiver thereof,
has undergone a review and been approved by the City of Rochester
after determining that the plan or waiver is consistent with the
requirements of this Part.
B. The applicant shall employ a responsible individual, as defined in
§ 39-441, who will oversee the implementation of the SWPPP on a daily
basis. The applicant shall also employ the services of a qualified
professional in erosion and sediment control who will inspect and
document the effectiveness of all erosion and sediment control
practices. The documentation will be kept in a site logbook. Inspection
reports will be completed every seven days and within 24 hours of any
storm event producing 0.5 inch of precipitation or more. A monthly
summary of reports will be copied to the site logbook and delivered to
City of Rochester within five days after the month's end.
C. All SWPPPs shall provide the following information:
(1) All information listed in § 39-407, Permit application materials.
(2) Description of each post-construction stormwater management
practice.
(3) Site map/construction drawing(s) showing the specific location(s)
and size(s) of each post-construction stormwater management
practice. The map(s) will also clearly show proposed land use with
tabulation of the percentage of surface area to be adapted to
various uses. A written description of the site plan and justification
of proposed changes in natural conditions may also be required.
(4) Hydrologic and hydraulic analysis for all structural components of
the stormwater management system for the applicable design
storms, including calculations such as a description of the design
storm frequency, intensity and duration; time of concentration; soil
curve numbers or runoff coefficients; peak runoff rates and total
runoff volumes for each watershed area; infiltration rates, where
applicable; culvert capacities; flow velocities; data on the increase
in rate and volume of runoff for the design storms referenced in the
New York State Stormwater Management Design Manual; and
documentation of sources for all computation methods and field

and skills or training necessary. Provisions for the periodic review
and evaluation of the effectiveness of the maintenance program
and the need for revisions or additional maintenance procedures
shall be included in the plan.
(8) The applicant must ensure access to all stormwater treatment
practices at the site for the purpose of inspection and repair by
securing all the maintenance easements needed on a permanent
basis. These easements will be recorded with the plan and will
remain in effect even with transfer of title to the property. See
§ 39-449 for additional information.
(9) The applicant must execute an easement and an inspection and
maintenance agreement binding on all subsequent owners of land
served by the on-site stormwater management measure(s) in
accordance with the specifications of this Part. See § 39-449 for
additional information.

moneys shall be paid to the cemetery office, which shall give a receipt
for the same, specifying the date, name of purchaser, location of
interment space purchased and the amount paid therefor, all of which
details shall be entered in the registered deeds, and a corresponding
deed shall be drawn and executed as required by the City Charter. This
deed may be obtained by the purchaser as soon as recorded upon giving
up the cash receipt at the cemetery office.
C. Cemetery space must be paid for in full before a burial, entombment or
inurnment may be completed.
D. In sections where single graves are sold there can be no choice of
location. The spaces shall be filled in regular order. In cases where two
single graves are purchased, one at need and the other pre-need, the
second grave will not be reserved for longer than 30 days without the
execution of a purchase contract.
E. The cemetery reserves the sole right to repurchase cemetery property
that has been deeded to the owner. The cemetery will reimburse the
owner for the original purchase price plus an amount equal to simple
interest at 2% per year since the time such property was acquired.
Perpetual care charges will not be reimbursed. For a grave space, any

interest in the cemetery property passes to his or her devisees or heirs
at law, subject to this section of the Code. In the case of joint tenancy,
upon the death of a tenant, his or her interest in the cemetery property
passes to the surviving tenants, subject only to the right of his or her
surviving spouse for interment herein.
§ 43-3 (RESERVED) § 43-4
42:793
B. A conveyance of cemetery property by the cemetery to spouses creates
in them a tenancy by the entirety, unless expressly declared to be joint
tenancy or a tenancy in common. In the case of tenancy by the entirety,
upon the death of one tenant, the whole interest of both remains in the
survivor.
C. Deceased owner.
(1) Upon the death of an owner or co-owner of a parcel of cemetery
property, unless the same shall be held in joint tenancy or tenancy
by the entirety, the interest of the deceased owner, to the extent
that such interest has not been exhausted by the deceased owner,
shall pass to his or her devisees or heirs at law subject to the
following limitations and conditions:
(a) If the deceased owner leaves a surviving spouse and children,
they shall have all rights of ownership of the deceased in
common, except that the spouse shall have only a right of
interment of himself or herself during his or her life.
(b) If the deceased owner leaves a surviving spouse but no
children, such spouse shall have all rights of ownership in such
interment space as the deceased, including the right and duty
to care for, possess and control any space in which interments
have been made.
(c) If the deceased owner leaves surviving children but no spouse,
such children, or the survivor of them, shall have in common all
rights in such interment space as the deceased, including the
right and duty to care for, possess and control any interment
space in which interments have been made.
(d) Interests in cemetery property shall be considered property
devised only if such property is specifically referred to in the
will of the deceased owner. If a will expresses no disposition of
such property, then the ownership shall not pass from the
lawful heirs of such owner by any residual or other general
clause but shall descend to such heirs as if the said owner had
died intestate. If, however, the owner is not survived by any
known lineal descendent and if the devisee under the residuary
clause is also related to the owner within the fifth degree of
consanguinity, ownership of such cemetery property shall pass
under such residuary clause.
(2) The parties having such ownership interest in the interment space
during the term thereof may erect a monument and make other
permanent improvements thereon subject to the rules and
regulations of the cemetery.
D. The surviving spouse shall have the right of interment for his or her
body in an interment space in which the deceased spouse was an owner
or co-owner at the time of his or her death, except where all the
§ 43-4 ROCHESTER CODE § 43-4
42:794
§ 43-5. Interments.
available interment spaces have been used for or designated for the
interment of persons other than the surviving spouse. A person interred
shall have the right to have his or her body remain permanently
interred therein, except that his or her body may be removed therefrom
to some other family interment space with the consent of his or her
heirs. Where more than one owner exists, the surviving spouse may
at any time release his or her right in such space, but no conveyance
or devise by any other person shall deprive him or her of such right.
Such right may be enforced and protected by his or her personal
representatives.
E. At any time when more than one person has an ownership interest in
cemetery property, any of the persons having an ownership interest
thereto may file with the cemetery an affidavit setting forth the names
and places of residence of all the persons having an ownership interest,
and the cemetery shall be entitled to rely upon the truth of the
statements contained in such affidavit.
F. At any time when more than one person has an ownership interest in
cemetery property, the co-owners shall file with the cemetery a
designation of a person who shall represent all the co-owners, and as
long as they shall fail to designate, the cemetery shall have the right to
make such designation.
G. A distributee may release his or her interest in cemetery property to
other distributes, and a joint owner may release or devise to the other
joint owners, his or her right in the property on the conditions specified
in the release or will, the original or certified copy of which shall be
filed in the office of the cemetery.
A. No interment of a body other than that of a human being shall be
permitted in the cemetery.
B. All orders for the opening of interment space shall be filed at the
cemetery office in writing on forms furnished by the cemetery subject
to the discretion of the Cemetery Manager or his or her designee. No
interments shall be allowed in the cemetery on Memorial Day, Fourth of
July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas or New Year's Day, except
in cases of death from a contagious disease when immediate burial is
ordered by the Monroe County Health Director.
C. Permission by an owner for the interment of persons not of the
immediate family of the owner within the owner's cemetery property
shall be in an acknowledged, written instrument in the form required by
the Cemetery Manager.
D. Funerals entering the cemetery grounds shall be subject to the
direction of the Cemetery Manager, or his or her designee. Funeral
§ 43-4 (RESERVED) § 43-5
42:795
directors entering the cemetery shall abide by the rules and regulations
of the cemetery.
E. Upon arrival at the cemetery, a funeral director must present to the
cemetery office a burial transit permit, issued by the Registrar of Vital
Statistics of the County of Monroe or other authority, before a burial or
entombment of body remains can take place. A burial or entombment
must proceed to conclusion once the receipt of decedent form has been
executed by the cemetery office and the decedent's remains have
entered the cemetery property.
F. For ground burials in lots, the grave to be opened on the lot must be
located by the lot owner or the funeral director. When, however, the
instructions for opening and closing a grave are indefinite or, for any
reason, the grave cannot be opened in the location specified, the
Cemetery Manager will order a grave opened at such location in the lot
as may seem best under the circumstances. Such action is necessary to
avoid the delay of funerals, and the City shall not be liable for any injury
or dissatisfaction resulting from its selection. When an order for
opening a grave is received by telephone, the cemetery will not be
responsible for any misunderstanding of location.
G. Graves shall be dug only by persons under the direction of the
Cemetery Manager or his or her designee.
H. Ground burial of the body remains of a deceased individual shall
require the use of an outer burial container made of precast concrete,
natural stone, or steel to enclose the casket and support the earth. The
use of an infant casket-vault combination for child interments will
satisfy the requirement. This requirement shall be waived in the
instance of a green burial approved by the Cemetery Manager.
I. Cremation burials shall include the use of an urn vault. The use of an
urn-vault combination will satisfy the requirement. This requirement
may be waived by the Cemetery Manager for areas in the cemetery that
have been designated as urn gardens or for cremation burials made
above a green burial.
J. The Cemetery Manager may designate locations in the cemetery that
are appropriate for the option of a green burial.
K. Additional interments may be made in a full body grave space, provided
that there is adequate space and approval is granted by the Cemetery
Manager. In addition to the normal fees charged for the opening and
closing of the grave, a right of interment fee will be assessed for each
subsequent cremation burial.
(1) Mount Hope Cemetery:
(a) Full burial. The cremains of up to four others shall be
permitted following the burial of the body remains of one
person, provided that an outer burial container is used in the
§ 43-5 ROCHESTER CODE § 43-5
42:796
initial burial to protect the integrity of the grave. Once a
cremation burial is made in the grave space, a subsequent full
body burial can be made only upon consent of the Cemetery
Manager.
(b) Double burial. Two full body burials are permitted in the same
grave space, provided that the owner elects this option at the
time of the first interment and an outer burial container is used
to protect the integrity of the grave. The first grave will then be
dug to a deeper depth to permit the subsequent interment of
another outer burial container and casket. The cremains of up
to four others shall be permitted following the second body
burial. Once a cremation burial is made in the grave space, any
subsequent full body burial can be made only upon consent of
the Cemetery Manager.

and/or second full body burial shall be negated once a
cremation burial is performed in the grave space.
(b) Double burial. The Cemetery Manager has the authority to
designate locations in the cemetery where double burials may
be made and issue appropriate rules governing this practice. In
these instances, two full body burials are permitted in the same
grave space, provided that the owner elects this option at the
time of the first interment and an outer burial container is used
to protect the integrity of the grave. The first grave will then be
dug to a deeper depth to permit the subsequent interment of
another outer burial container and casket. The cremains of up
to two others shall be permitted following the second body
burial. The right of the first and/or second full body burial shall
be negated once a cremation burial is performed in the grave

Commissioner refuses consent, an order of the Supreme Court
requiring the exhumation, disentombment or disinurnment shall be
sufficient.
C. The cemetery may perform a disinterment to correct an error made in a
prior interment and may transfer the erroneously interred remains to
an alternate interment space within the cemetery. In such instance,
only the Commissioner's approval is needed in order for the

D. A funeral director must present to the cemetery office a burial transit

strength and rigidity so that no part of the body shall become exposed
during handling by crematory personnel.
G. Heart pacemakers, prosthesis, or any mechanical or radioactive devices
or implants are dangerous when placed in a cremation chamber. The
City will not be responsible or accept any liability in instances when a

decedent. The person or persons authorizing the cremation will be

Title, Purpose, Findings and Definitions
§ 43A-1. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be referred to as the "Rochester
Coastal Erosion Hazard Area Law."
§ 43A-2. General purpose and intent.
The City of Rochester hereby assumes the responsibility to implement and
administer a coastal erosion management program within its boundaries
pursuant to Article 34 of New York State Environmental Conservation Law.
To this end, this chapter is enacted to.
§ 43A-3. Findings.
It is hereby determined that the Coastal Erosion Hazard Area:
A. Establish standards and procedures for minimizing and preventing
damage to structures from coastal flooding and erosion and to protect
natural protective features and other natural resources.
B. Regulate in coastal areas subject to coastal flooding and erosion, land
use and development activities so as to minimize or prevent damage or
destruction to man-made property, natural protective features or other
natural resources and to protect human life.
C. Regulate new construction or placement of structures in order to place
them a safe distance from areas of active erosion and the impacts of
coastal storms to ensure that these structures are not prematurely
destroyed or damaged due to improper siting, as well as to prevent
damage to natural protective features and other natural resources.
D. Restrict public investment in services, facilities or activities which are
likely to encourage new permanent development in erosion hazard
areas.
E. Regulate the construction of erosion protection structures in coastal
areas subject to serious erosion, to assure that when the construction of
erosion protection structures is justified, their construction and
operation will minimize or prevent damage or destruction to man-made
property, private and public property, natural protective features and
other natural resources.
A. Is prone to erosion from action of Lake Ontario. Such erosion may be
caused by the action of waves, currents running along the shore and
wind-driven water and ice. Such areas are also prone to erosion caused
by the wind, runoff of rainwater along the surface of the land or
groundwater seepage, as well as by human activities such as
construction, navigation and certain forms of recreation.
§ 43A-1 (RESERVED) § 43A-3
42:805
§ 43A-4. Definitions.
When used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
herein ascribed to them, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:
ADMINISTRATOR  The Commissioner of Neighborhood and Business
Development of the City of Rochester.[Amended 6-16-2009 by Ord. No.
2009-179]
BEACH  The zone of unconsolidated earth that extends landward from the
mean low water line to the waterward toe of a dune or bluff, whichever is
most waterward. Where no dune or bluff exists landward of a beach, the
landward limit of a beach is 100 feet landward from the place where there
is a marked change in material or physiographic form or from the line of
permanent vegetation, whichever is most waterward. Shorelands subject
to seasonal or more frequent overwash or inundation are considered to be
beaches.
BLUFF  Any bank or cliff with a precipitous or steeply sloped face
adjoining a beach or a body of water. The waterward limit of a bluff is the
landward limit of its waterward natural protective feature. Where no beach
is present, the waterward limit of a bluff is mean low water. The landward
limit is 25 feet landward of the receding edge or, in those where there is no
discernible line of active erosion, 25 feet landward of the point of inflection
on the top of the bluff. (The point of inflection is that point along the top of
the bluff where the trend of the land slope changes to begin its descent to
the shoreline).
B. Experiences coastal erosion which causes extensive damage to
publicly- and privately-owned properties and to natural resources as
well as endangering human lives. When this occurs, individuals and
private businesses suffer significant economic losses, as do the City of
Rochester and the state economies, either directly through property
damage or indirectly through loss of economic return. Large public
expenditures may also be necessitated for the removal of debris and
damaged structures and replacement of essential public facilities and
services.
C. Experiences erosion-related problems that are often contributed to by
man's building without considering the potential for damage to
property, by undertaking activities which destroy natural protective
features such as dunes or vegetation, by building structures intended
for erosion-prevention which may exacerbate erosion conditions on
adjacent or nearby property and by water action produced by wakes
from boats.
D. Is the subject of programs which foster erosion protection structures,
either with private or public funds, which are costly, often only partially
effective over time and may even be harmful to adjacent or nearby
properties. In some instances major erosion protection structures of
great length would be required to effectively reduce future damages
due to erosion.
§ 43A-3 ROCHESTER CODE § 43A-4
42:806
COASTAL EROSION HAZARD AREA MAP  The final map and any
amendments thereof issued by the Commissioner of the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation, which delineates boundaries of
Coastal Erosion Hazard Areas subject to regulation under this chapter.
COASTLINE and COASTAL WATERS  The lands adjacent to the City of
Rochester's coastal waters are the coastline. Coastal waters are Lake Erie,
Lake Ontario, St. Lawrence River, the Niagara River and the connecting
water bodies, bays, harbors, shallows and marshes.
DEBRIS LINE  A linear accumulation of waterborne debris deposited on a
beach by storm-induced high water or by wave action.
DUNE  A ridge or hill of loose, windblown or artificially placed earth the
principal component of which is sand.
EROSION  The loss or displacement of land along the coastline due to
the action of waves, currents, wind-driven water, waterborne ice or other
impacts of storms. It also means the loss or displacement of land due to the
action of wind, runoff of surface waters or groundwaters or groundwater
seepage.
EROSION HAZARD AREA  An area of the coastline which is a structural
hazard area or a natural protective feature area.
EROSION PROTECTION STRUCTURE  A structure specifically designed
to reduce or prevent erosion such as a groin, jetty, revetment, breakwater
or artificial beach nourishment project.
EXISTING STRUCTURE  A structure and all appurtenances in existence
or one where construction has commenced or one where construction has
not begun but for which a building permit has been issued prior to the
effective date of this chapter.
GRADING  A redistribution of sand or other unconsolidated earth to effect
a change in profile.
MAJOR ADDITION  An addition to a structure resulting in a 25% or
greater increase in the ground area coverage of the structure other than an
erosion protection structure or a pier, dock or wharf. The increase will be
calculated as the ground area coverage to be added, including any additions
previously constructed under a coastal erosion management permit, divided
by the ground area coverage of the existing structure as defined herein.
MEAN LOW WATER  The approximate average low water level for a given
body of water at a given location, determined by reference to hydrological
information concerning water levels or other appropriate tests.
MOVABLE STRUCTURE  A structure designed and constructed to be
readily relocated with minimum disruption of the intended use. Mobile
homes and structures built on skids or piles and not having a permanent
foundation are examples of movable structures.
NATURAL PROTECTIVE FEATURE  A nearshore area, beach, bluff,
primary dune, secondary dune or marsh and its vegetation.
§ 43A-4 (RESERVED) § 43A-4
42:807
NATURAL PROTECTIVE FEATURE AREA  A land and/or water area
containing natural protective features, the alteration of which might reduce
or destroy the protection afforded other lands against erosion or high water
or lower the reserve of sand or other natural materials available to replenish
storm losses through natural processes.
NEARSHORE AREA  Those lands under water beginning at the mean low
water line and extending waterward in a direction perpendicular to the
shoreline to a point where mean low water depth is 15 feet or to a horizontal
distance of 1,000 feet from the mean low water line, whichever is greater.
NORMAL MAINTENANCE  Periodic replacement or repair of same-kind
structural elements or protective coatings which do not change the size,
design or function of a functioning structure. A functioning structure is one
which is fully performing as originally designed at the time that normal
maintenance is scheduled to begin. Normal maintenance of a structure does
not require a coastal erosion management permit.
PERSON  Any individual, public or private corporation, political
subdivision, government agency, public government district, partnership,
association, firm, trust, estate or any other legal entity whatsoever.
PRIMARY DUNE  The most waterward major dune where there are two
or more parallel lines within a coastal area. Where there is only one dune
present, it is the primary one. Occasionally, one or more relatively small
dune formations exist waterward of the primary dune. These smaller
formations will be considered to be part of the primary dune for the
purposes of this chapter. The waterward limit of a primary dune is the
landward limit of its fronting beach. The landward limit of the primary dune
is 25 feet landward of its landward toe.
RECEDING EDGE  The most landward line of active erosion or, in cases
where there is no discernible line of active erosion, the most waterward line
of permanent vegetation.
RECESSION RATE  The rate, expressed in feet per year, at which an
eroding shoreline moves landward.
REGULATED ACTIVITY  The construction, modification, restoration or
placement of a structure or major addition to a structure or any action or
use of land which materially alters the condition of land, including grading,
excavating, dumping, mining, dredging, filling or other disturbance of soil.
RESTORATION  The reconstruction without modification of a structure,
the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the estimated full replacement
cost of the structure at the time of restoration. Modifications, however, may
be allowed if they do not exceed pre-existing size limits and are intended to
mitigate impacts to natural protective features and other natural resources.
SECONDARY DUNE  The major dune immediately landward of the
primary dune. The waterward limit of a secondary dune is the landward
limit of its fronting primary dune. The landward limit of a secondary dune is
25 feet landward of its landward toe.
§ 43A-4 ROCHESTER CODE § 43A-4
42:808
SIGNIFICANT FISH AND WILDLIFE HABITAT  Those habitats which are
essential to the survival of a large portion of a particular fish or wildlife
population, support rare or endangered species, are found at a very low
frequency within a geographic area, support fish or wildlife populations
having significant commercial or recreational value or that would be
difficult or impossible to replace.
STRUCTURE HAZARD AREAS  Those shorelands located landward of
natural protective features and having shorelines receding at a long-term
average recession rate of one foot or more per year. The inland boundary
of a structural hazard area is calculated by starting at the landward limit
of the fronting natural protective feature and measuring along a line
perpendicular to the shoreline a horizontal distance landward which is 40
times the long-term average annual recession rate.
STRUCTURE  Any object constructed, installed or placed in, on, or under
land or water, including but not limited to a building, permanent shed, deck,
in-ground and aboveground pool, garage, mobile home, road, public service
distribution, transmission or collection system, tanks, docks, piers, wharf,
groins, jetties, sea walls, bulkheads, breakwaters, revetments, artificial
beach nourishment or any addition to or alteration of the same.
TOE  The lowest surface point on a slope face of a dune or bluff.
UNREGULATED ACTIVITY  Activities which are not regulated by this
chapter, including but not limited to elevated walkways or stairways
constructed solely for pedestrian use and built by an individual property
owner for the limited purpose of providing noncommercial access to the
beach; docks, piers, wharves or structures built on floats, columns, open
timber piles or other similar openwork supports with a top surface area
of less than 200 square feet or which are removed in the fall of each
year; normal beach grooming or cleanup; maintenance of structures when
normal and customary and/or in compliance with an approved maintenance
program; planting vegetation and sand fencing so as to stabilize or entrap
sand in primary dune and secondary dune areas in order to maintain or
increase the height and width of dunes; routine agricultural operations
including cultivation or harvesting, and the implementation of practices
recommended in a soil and water conservation plan as defined in § 3(12)
of the Soil and Water Conservation Districts Law; provided, however, that
agricultural operations and implementation of practices will not be
construed to include any activities that involve the construction or
placement of a structure.
VEGETATION  Plant life capable of surviving and successfully
reproducing in the area or region and which is compatible with the
environment of the Coastal Erosion Hazard Area.
§ 43A-4 (RESERVED) § 43A-4
42:809

ARTICLE II
Coastal Erosion Hazard Area
§ 43A-5. Areas established.
The Coastal Erosion Hazard Area is hereby established to classify land and
water areas within the City of Rochester, based upon shoreline recession
rates or the location of natural protective features. The Coastal Erosion
Hazard Area consists of the Natural Protective Feature Area and the
Structural Hazard Area. The boundaries of the Coastal Erosion Hazard
Area, Natural Protective Feature Area and Structural Hazard Area are those
boundaries for each such area delineated as such and established on the
final map prepared by the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation under § 34-0104 of the New York State Environmental
Conservation Law and entitled "Coastal Erosion Hazard Area Map of the
City of Rochester," including all amendments thereto by the Commissioner
of the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.

a letter of credit, or similar security acceptable to the
Administrator and a fully executed agreement in the form
provided by the City. The letter of credit in favor of the City of
Rochester for the estimated cost of activity shall be
unconditional and irrevocable for a period not to exceed two
years. The agreement shall also be irrevocable for a period of
two years and shall permit the City of Rochester to enter the
subject property and to install such improvements if the
applicant fails to do so within the period of time specified in the
agreement. Such letter of credit or similar security and the
agreement, each in a form satisfactory to the Administrator,
shall be submitted prior to obtaining a building permit as a
condition of permit approval. Should the applicant fail to
perform the activity within the agreed period of time, the
Administrator shall issue a written notice of such failure to the
applicant. It shall be sufficient service of such notice if it is
mailed to the applicant at the address provided in the permit
§ 43A-6 ROCHESTER CODE § 43A-6

application. If the applicant fails to perform the required
activity within 15 days of the issuance of such notice, the
Administrator is authorized to draw upon the letter of credit
or other security as may be necessary to cover the costs to
the City to perform work which the applicant failed to perform.
The applicant may request a hearing before the Administrator
within five days from the issuance of the notice. The hearing
will be held before the expiration of the fifteen-day notice
period. The letter of credit or other security, described in this
subsection, may be waived by the Administrator where:
[1] No site improvements or alterations to the site are
associated with the application for permit approval and no
site improvement conditions have been attached to such
approval.
[2] None of the proposed or required site improvements will
have any discernible impact on adjacent private property
or on the public right-of-way and such improvements
primarily affect the user of the property and not adjacent
property owners or the general public.
[3] Evidence of the applicants satisfactory completion of prior
site plan review projects pursuant to Chapter 120 of the
City Code and/or this chapter is offered in lieu of a letter of
credit. [Amended 11-19-2002 by Ord. No. 2002-354]

issuing the permit, issuing the permit subject to conditions or
denying the application. Within seven days of such decision, the
Administrator shall mail notice of the decision to the applicant.
(3) General standards. A permit shall be issued only if the
Administrator determines that the proposed activity:
(a) Is reasonable and necessary, considering reasonable
alternatives to the proposed activity and the extent to which
the proposed activity requires a shoreline location.
(b) Is not likely to cause a measurable increase in erosion at the
proposed site and at other locations.
(c) Prevents, if possible, or minimizes adverse effects on natural
protective features and their functions and protective values,
existing erosion protection structures and natural resources.

§ 43A-6 (RESERVED) § 43A-6
42:813
§ 43A-7. Structural hazard area.
The following restrictions apply to regulated activities within Structural
Hazard Areas:
(a) Permits will be issued by and bear the name and signature of
the Administrator and will specify the:
[1] Activity or operation for which the permit is issued.
[2] Address or location where the activity or operation is to be
conducted.
[3] Name and address of permittee.
[4] Permit number and date of issuance.
[5] Period of permit validity. If not otherwise specified, a
permit will expire one year from the date of issuance.
[6] The terms and conditions of the approval.
(b) If more than one permit is required for the same property or
premises under this chapter, a single permit may be issued
listing all activities permitted and any conditions, restrictions
or bonding requirements. Revocation of a portion or portions of
such consolidated permits will not invalidate the remainder of
the permit.
(c) A permit may be issued with such terms and conditions as are
necessary to ensure compliance with the policies and
provisions of Article 34 of the Environmental Conservation
Law, the Coastal Erosion Management Regulations
implementing Article 34, 6 NYCRR 505 and this chapter.
(d) When an application is made for a coastal erosion management
permit, variance thereto or other form of approval required by
this chapter and such activity is subject to other permit,
variance, hearing or application procedures required by
another federal, state or local regulatory agency pursuant to
any federal, state or local law or ordinance, the Administrator
shall, at the request of the applicant consolidate and
coordinate to the extent practicable the application, permit,
variance and hearing procedures as required by each
regulatory agency into a single comprehensive hearing and
review procedure. However, nothing contained in this section
shall be deemed to limit or restrict any regulatory agencies,
which are properly a party to such a consolidated review
proceeding, from the independent exercise of such
discretionary authority with respect to the issuance, denial or
modification of such permits, variance or other forms of
approval as they may have been granted by law.
§ 43A-6 ROCHESTER CODE § 43A-7
42:814
§ 43A-8. Nearshore area.
A. A coastal erosion management permit is required for the installation of
public service distribution, transmission or collection systems for gas,
electricity, water or wastewater. Systems installed along the shoreline
must be located landward of the shoreline structures.
B. The construction of nonmovable structures or placement of major
nonmovable additions to an existing structure is prohibited.
C. Permanent foundations may not be attached to movable structures, and
any temporary foundations are to be removed at the time the structure
is made. Below-grade footings will be allowed if satisfactory provisions
are made for their removal.
D. No movable structure may be located closer to the landward limit of a
bluff than 25 feet.
E. No movable structure may be placed or constructed such that
according to accepted engineering practice, its weight places excessive
groundloading on a bluff.
F. Plans for landward relocation of movable structures must be included
with each application for a permit. Movable structures which have been
located within a Structural Hazard Area pursuant to a coastal erosion
management permit must be removed before any part of the structure
is within 10 feet of the receding edge. The owner of record is
responsible for removing that structure and its foundation, unless a
removal agreement was attached to the original coastal erosion
management permit. With the attachment of a removal agreement to
the coastal erosion management permit, the landowner or the signature
is responsible for the landward relocation of movable structures.
Removal agreements may be made when the last owner of record and
the owner of the structure are different, with the approval of the
Administrator at the time the permit is issued.
G. Debris from structural damage which may occur as a result of sudden
unanticipated bluff edge failure, dune migration or wave or ice action
must be removed within 60 days of the damaging event.
H. Any grading, excavation or other soil disturbance conducted within a
Structural Hazard Area must not direct surface water runoff over a bluff
face.
A. Findings. Nearshore areas dissipate a substantial amount of wave
energy before it is expended on beaches, bluffs or dunes by causing
waves to collapse or break. Nearshore areas also function as reservoirs
of sand, gravel and other unconsolidated material for beaches.
Sandbars, which are located in nearshore areas, control the orientation
of incoming waves and promote the development of ice cap formations
which help protect shorelines during winter storms. The roots of
§ 43A-7 (RESERVED) § 43A-8
42:815
§ 43A-9. Beach area.
§ 43A-10. Dune area.
aquatic vegetation in nearshore areas bind fine-grained silts, clays and
organic matter to form a fairly cohesive bottom that resists erosion.
B. Restrictions. The following restrictions apply to regulated activities in
nearshore areas:
(1) Excavating, grading, mining or dredging which diminishes the
erosion protection afforded by nearshore area is prohibited, except
construction or maintenance of navigation channels, bypassing
sand around natural and man-made obstructions and artificial
beach nourishment shall require a coastal erosion management
permit.
(2) Clean sand or gravel of an equivalent or slightly larger grain size is
the only material which may be deposited within nearshore areas.
Any deposition shall require a coastal erosion management permit.
(3) All development is prohibited in nearshore areas unless specifically
provided for by this chapter.
A. Findings. Beaches buffer shorelands from erosion by absorbing wave
energy that otherwise would be expended on the toes of bluffs or dunes.
Beaches that are high and wide protect shorelands from erosion more
effectively than beaches that are low or narrow. Beaches also act as
reservoirs of sand or other unconsolidated material for longshore
littoral transport and offshore sandbar and shoal formation.
B. Restrictions. The following restrictions apply to regulated activities in
beach areas:
(1) Excavating, grading or mining which diminishes the erosion
protection afforded by beaches is prohibited.
(2) Clean sand or gravel of an equivalent or slightly larger grain size is
the only material which may be deposited within beach areas. Any
deposition shall require a coastal erosion management permit,
which may be issued only for expansion or stabilization of beaches.
(3) Active bird-nesting and breeding areas must not be disturbed
unless such disturbance is pursuant to a specific wildlife
management activity approved, in writing, by the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation.
(4) All development is prohibited on beaches unless specifically
provided for by this chapter.
A. Findings. Dunes prevent overtopping and store sand for coastal
processes. High, vegetated dunes provide a greater degree of
protection than low, unvegetated ones. Dunes are of the greatest
§ 43A-8 ROCHESTER CODE § 43A-10
42:816
protective value during conditions of storm-induced high water.
Because dunes often protect some of the most biologically productive
areas as well as developed coastal areas, their protective value is
especially great. The key to maintaining a stable dune system is the
establishment and maintenance of beach grass or other vegetation on
the dunes and assurance of a supply of nourishment sand to the dunes.
B. Restrictions. The following restrictions apply to regulated activities in
dune areas:
(1) In primary dune areas:
(a) Excavating, grading or mining of primary dunes is prohibited.
(b) Clean sand of a compatible type and size is the only material
which may be deposited. Any deposition shall require a coastal
erosion management permit.
(c) All depositions must be vegetatively stabilized using species
tolerant of the conditions at the site and must be placed so as
to increase the size of or restore a dune or dune area.
(d) Active bird-nesting and breeding areas must not be disturbed
unless such disturbance is pursuant to a specific wildlife
management activity approved, in writing, by the New York
State Department of Environmental Conservation.
(e) Nonmajor additions to existing structures are allowed on
primary dunes subject to the issuance of a coastal erosion
management permit, in conformance with any permit
conditions concerning the location, design and potential
impacts of the structure on the primary dune.
(f) Stone revetments or other erosion protection structures
compatible with primary dunes will only be allowed at the
waterward toe of primary dunes and must not interfere with
the exchange of sand between primary dunes and their
fronting beaches.
(2) In secondary dune areas:
(a) All depositions must be of clean sand of a compatible type and

source of depositional material for beaches and other unconsolidated
natural protective features.
B. Restrictions. The following activities are prohibited on bluffs:
(1) Excavating or mining, except when in conjunction with conditions
stated in a coastal erosion management permit issued for minor
alterations in construction of an erosion protection structure or for
provision of shoreline access.

development site or at other locations.
(2) Minimize and, if possible, prevent adverse effects upon natural
protective features, existing erosion protection structures and
natural resources, such as significant fish and wildlife habitats.
B. All erosion protection structures must be designed and constructed
according to generally accepted engineering principles or, where
sufficient data is not currently available, must have a likelihood of
success in controlling long-term erosion. The protective measures must
have a reasonable probability of controlling erosion on the immediate
site for at least 30 years.
C. All materials used in such structures must be durable and capable of
withstanding inundation, wave impacts, weathering and other effects of
storm conditions for a minimum of 30 years. Individual component
materials may have a working life of less than 30 years only when a
maintenance program ensures that they will be regularly maintained
and replaced as necessary to attain the required 30 years of erosion
protection.
D. A long-term maintenance program must be included with every permit
application of construction, modification or restoration of an erosionprotection
structure. The maintenance program must include
specifications for normal maintenance of degradable materials. To
assure compliance with the proposed maintenance programs, a bond
may be required.

Coastal Erosion Hazard Board of Review
§ 43A-16. Coastal Erosion Hazard Board of Review.
§ 43A-17. Appeals.
A. The Rochester Environmental Commission is hereby designated as the
Coastal Erosion Hazard Board of Review, hereinafter referred to as the
Board of Review.
B. The Board of Review shall have the following jurisdiction and authority:
(1) Subject to the provisions of § 43A-17 hereof, to hear and decide
appeals from and review orders, including stop or cease-and-desist
orders, decisions or determinations made by the Administrator
and, to that end, shall have the power of the Administrator with
respect to such order, decision or determination.
(2) Subject to the provisions of § 43A-18 hereof, to grant or deny
variances from the requirements of this chapter.
(3) Subject to the provisions of § 43A-27 hereof, to initiate changes and
amendments to this chapter.
C. Form of decision. Each decision of the Board of Review shall be by
written resolution which shall include findings of fact, shall refer to all
the evidence in the record and any documentation upon which such
decision is based, shall specify the reason or reasons for such decision,
shall contain a conclusion or statement separate from the findings of
fact setting forth the specific relief granted or denying relief and shall
expressly set forth any limitations or conditions imposed on any relief
granted or activity authorized.
A. Authority. The Board of Review shall hear and decide appeals from and
review orders, decisions, determinations or the failure to act of the
Administrator and to that end shall have the same powers and be
subject to the same standards and limitations as the Administrator with
respect to any order, decision or determination being appealed.
B. Parties entitled to appeal. An appeal may be taken to the Board of
Review by any applicant or aggrieved owner of property which is either
within the Coastal Erosion Hazard Area or contiguous thereto and is
affected by a decision of the Administrator.
C. Procedure.
(1) Notice of appeal. Appeal to the Board of Review shall be taken
within 30 days of the action complained of by filing with the
Administrator, in two duplicate copies, a notice of appeal specifying
the grounds therefor. A nonrefundable fee in the amount set forth
in § 43A-29 hereof to help defray administrative costs shall
§ 43A-16 (RESERVED) § 43A-17
42:823
§ 43A-18. Variances.
accompany the notice of appeal. The Administrator shall forthwith
transmit one copy of the notice of appeal together with all papers
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was
taken to the Board of Review. The Board of Review shall transmit
a copy to the Commissioner of the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation for his or her information.
(2) Action by Board. Within 30 days of receipt of the notice of appeal,
the Board of Review shall render a written decision on the appeal,
in the form specified in § 43A-16C hereof. Such decision may
reverse, affirm or modify, in whole or in part, the action appealed
from and may include such order or determination as, in the
opinion of the Board of Review, is proper to be made. The failure of
the Board of Review to act within such 30 days shall be deemed a
denial of the appeal. Within seven days of such decision or the
expiration of such period, notice of such decision or failure to act
shall be mailed by the Administrator to each appellant and, if
different, to the owner(s) of the subject property and to the
applicant for any permit which was the subject of the appeal.
D. Right to grant variance in deciding appeals. In any case where the
notice of appeal is accompanied by any application for variance, in
accordance with § 43A-18 hereof, the Board of Review shall have the
authority to grant, as part of the relief, a variance, but only in strict
compliance with each provision of § 43A-18.
E. Conditions and limitations on rights granted by appeal. In any case
where this chapter imposes conditions and limitations upon any right,
any such right granted by the Board of Review on appeal shall be
subject to such conditions and limitations in the same manner and to
the same extent as if secured without the necessity of an appeal.
A. Authority. The Board of Appeals may authorize such variances from the
provisions of this chapter as will not be contrary to the spirit of this
chapter, the public safety and welfare and substantial justice for the
applicant and owners and residents of surrounding properties.
Variances may be authorized only in accordance with the standards
enumerated in Subsection E of this section and then only in compliance
with the procedures of Subsection D of this section.
B. Purpose. The variance procedure is intended to provide a narrowly
circumscribed means by which relief may be granted from unforeseen
particular applications of this chapter which create unnecessary
hardships or practical difficulties. Only when such hardships or
difficulties are not appropriate for remedy pursuant to other provisions
of this chapter is the variance procedure appropriate.
C. Initiation. An application for a variance may be filed by the owner of or
any other person having a contractual interest in the subject property.
§ 43A-17 ROCHESTER CODE § 43A-18
42:824
D. Procedure.
(1) Application. Applications for a variance shall be submitted in two
duplicate copies to the Administrator. A nonrefundable application
fee as set forth in § 43A-29 hereof, to help defray administrative
costs and costs of a hearing, shall accompany each application. The
application shall be in such form and contain such information and
documentation as shall be prescribed from time to time by the
Administrator but shall in all instances contain at least the
following information and documentation:
(a) The name and address of the applicant and his or her interest
in the subject property.
(b) The name and address of the owner, if different than the
applicant, and the owner's signed consent to the filing of the
application.

this chapter which would be necessary to permit the proposed
use or construction.
(h) A statement of the unnecessary hardship or practical difficulty
which would result if said particular requirements of this
chapter were applied to the subject property. Such statement
shall expressly refer to the standards contained in Subsection
E of this section and shall state what evidence supports the
compliance with such standards.
(i) In any case where inability to realize a reasonable return or
other economic hardship is alleged or required to be shown, a
statement setting forth the applicant's cost of purchase and
date of purchase and the present value of the subject property;
the total and itemized income produced by and the total and
itemized expenses, including real property taxes, incurred in
the use of the subject property during at least the last two
calendar years, a summary of all details pertaining to any

Administrator or the Board of Review may deem necessary or
appropriate to full and proper consideration and disposition of
the particular application.

the Administrator shall refer it to the Board of Review for decision
as hereinafter provided.
(3) Action by Board of Review. Within 30 days of receipt of a completed
application from the Administrator, the Board of Review shall
render its decision, granting or denying the variance, granting the
variance upon conditions or granting a variance with lesser relief
than requested. The decision shall be in the form specified in
§ 43A-16C hereof. The failure of the Board of Review to act shall be
deemed a denial of the variance. Within seven days following such
decision or the expiration of such period, the Administrator shall
mail notice of such decision or failure to act to each applicant for
the variance.
E. Standards for variance. No variance from the provisions of this chapter
may be granted unless the applicant shall establish each of the
following:
(1) Carrying out the strict letter of the provisions of this chapter would
create unnecessary hardships or would create practical difficulty.
(2) No reasonable, prudent, alternative site is available.
(3) All responsible means and measures to mitigate adverse impacts on
natural systems and their functions and values have been
incorporated into the activities design at the property owner's
expense.
(4) The development will be reasonably safe from flood and erosion
damage.
(5) The variance requested is the minimum necessary to overcome the
practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship which was the basis for
the requested variance.
(6) Where public funds are utilized, the public benefits must clearly
outweigh the long-term adverse effects.
F. Limitation on variance. No variance of the provisions of this chapter
involving a permit shall be valid for a period longer than one year
unless the permit is issued and the activity is actually begun within that
period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion.
A. Second applications without new grounds barred. Whenever any
application, appeal or other request filed pursuant to this chapter has

aggrieved by such decision or by any authorized officer, department, board
or bureau or commission of the City in conformance with Article 78 of the
New York State Civil Practice Law and Rules.
been finally denied on its merits, a second application, appeal or other
request seeking essentially the same relief, whether or not in the same
form or on the same theory, shall not be brought unless, in the opinion
of the officer or board before which it is brought, substantial new
evidence is available or a mistake of law or fact significantly affected
the prior denial.
B. New grounds to be stated. Any such second application shall include a
detailed statement of grounds justifying consideration of such
application.
C. Summary denial. Such application may be denied summarily on a
finding that no grounds appear which warrant a new hearing.
D. Exception. Any such second application filed more than two years after
the final denial of a prior application shall be presumed to be based on
new grounds and shall be heard on the merits as though no prior
application had been filed.

The provisions, regulations, procedures and standards of this chapter will
be held to be the minimum requirements necessary to carry out the
purposes of this chapter.

places safe and attractive for use by all members of the community
and to maintain and preserve public places where all of the community
can interact in a peaceful manner. This legislation is also intended
to provide for the free flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic on
streets and sidewalks in the City, to promote tourism and business and
preserve the quality of urban life. The Council finds that aggressive
acts associated with solicitation tend to interfere with the free flow of
pedestrian and vehicular traffic and intimidate persons in public places,
and can lead to disruption and disorder in public places. Aggressive
acts can also cause persons to avoid public places and lead to declining
patronage of commercial establishments and tourism. The Council
further finds that solicitation in certain public places is inconsistent
with the use of those places, is inherently intimidating, targets persons
who are captive audiences or constitutes an invasion of privacy as
persons are not able to simply move on if they do not wish to speak
to the person soliciting. Solicitation in proximity to bank entrances or
check-cashing businesses or automated teller machines is inherently
intimidating and should be restricted. By this legislation, the Council
intends to promote the health, safety and welfare of the citizens and
visitors to the City.
B. Definitions. Whenever the following words and phrases are used in this
section, they shall have the following meanings:
AGGRESSIVE MANNER 
Intentionally or recklessly making any physical contact with or
touching another person in the course of the solicitation, or
approaching within an arm's length of the person, except with the
person's consent;

Following the person being solicited, if that conduct is:
Intended to or is likely to cause a reasonable person to fear
imminent bodily harm or the commission of a criminal act upon
property in the person's possession; or
(a)
Is intended to or is reasonably likely to intimidate the person
being solicited into responding affirmatively to the solicitation;
(b)
(2)
Continuing to solicit within five feet of the person being solicited
after the person has made a negative response, if continuing the
solicitation is:

the following findings: [Added 9-11-1991 by Ord. No. 91-401]
(1) The consumption of alcoholic beverages in public places, except
under certain licensed circumstances, is detrimental to the health,
safety and welfare of the residents of the City and visitors.

(3) Based upon facts presented by citizens, community groups and law
enforcement personnel, the possession of open containers of
alcoholic beverages with intent to consume such beverages in
public places and the actual consumption of such beverages in
public places is a serious, substantial and significant cause of
persons, including those persons who are under the legal age for
possessing alcohol, becoming unruly, disruptive, disorderly and
creating a condition detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of
the community.
(4) There is a significant relationship between possession of open
containers of alcoholic beverages in public places and the general
health, safety and welfare of the community.
(5) There is a significant relationship between the possession of open
containers of alcoholic beverages in public places with the intent to
consume the same and the consumption of alcoholic beverages in
public places.

A. Purpose and intent. The Council finds that violent crime is a serious
problem in the City and firearms and other dangerous weapons are
frequently used in the commission of crimes, particularly homicides and
assaults. The possession of such weapons also often leads to accidental
deaths and injuries. The possession and use of assault weapons and
ammunition feeding devices for criminal purposes is increasing and
poses a serious danger to public safety. The use of weapons by persons
under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol can readily lead to serious
injury or death. The possession of weapons in public facilities and
places also poses a serious danger to public safety. The possession of
toy or imitation weapons which substantially duplicate actual weapons
poses a danger to the person possessing the weapon and to others. In
order to promote and protect the health, safety and welfare of the
389. Editor's Note: For additional provisions relating to firearms, see Ch. 43, Cemeteries,

possession and use of such weapons. The restrictions imposed by this
section are intended to be in addition to restrictions found in state law
and are not intended to conflict with state law provisions.

notice and order or orders, whether or not carried out pursuant to
court order, may be met from any appropriations made therefor or,
if such appropriation has not been made or is insufficient, from the
proceeds of the sale of obligations pursuant to the Local Finance
Law. The Department shall keep a record of such notices and
orders, together with the acts done and items of cost incurred in
their execution. [Amended 7-15-2008 by Ord. No. 2008-254;

§ 56-1. Statutory authorization and purpose.
A. Findings. The City Council of the City of Rochester finds that the
potential and/or actual damages from flooding and erosion may be a
problem to the residents of the City of Rochester and that such
damages may include destruction or loss of private and public housing,
damage to public facilities, both publicly and privately owned, and
injury to and loss of human life. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes and objectives hereinafter set
forth, this chapter is adopted.
B. Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions
designed to:
(1) Regulate uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property
due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
(2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction;
(3) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the
accommodation of floodwaters;
(4) Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which
may increase erosion or flood damages;
(5) Regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally
divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands; and
(6) Qualify for and maintain participation in the National Flood
Insurance Program.
C. Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are:

§ 56-2. Definitions.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common
usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
APPEAL  For purposes of this chapter, a request for a review of the Local
Administrator's interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request
for a special permit.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING  A designated AO, AH or VO Zone on
a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one-percent or
greater annual chance of flooding to an average annual depth of one foot to
three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path
of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD  The land in the floodplain within
a community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any
given year. This area may be designated as Zone A, AE, AH, AO, A1-A30,
A99, V, VO, VE, or V1-V30. It is also commonly referred to as the "base
floodplain" or "100-year floodplain." For purposes of this chapter, the term
"special flood hazard area (SFHA)" is synonymous in meaning with the
phrase "area of special flood hazard."
BASE FLOOD  The flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
(1) To protect human life and health;
(2) To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
(3) To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general
public;
(4) To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water

C. Interpretation and conflict with other ordinances.
(1) This chapter includes all revisions to the National Flood Insurance
Program through October 27, 1997, and shall supersede all
previous laws adopted for the purpose of flood damage prevention.
(2) In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements, adopted for the
promotion of the public health, safety, and welfare. Whenever the
requirements of this chapter are at variance with the requirements
of any other lawfully adopted rules, regulations, or ordinances, the
most restrictive, or that imposing the higher standards, shall
govern.
D. Severability. The invalidity of any section or provision of this chapter
shall not invalidate any other section or provision thereof.
E. Penalties for noncompliance. No structure in an area of special flood
hazard shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or
altered and no land shall be excavated or filled without full compliance
with the terms of this chapter and any other applicable regulations. Any
infraction of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any
of its requirements, including infractions of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with conditions of the permit, shall constitute
a violation. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined no more
than $250 or imprisoned for not more than 15 days, or both. Each day of
noncompliance shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein
contained shall prevent the City of Rochester from taking such other
lawful action as necessary to prevent or remedy an infraction. Any

be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the area of special flood hazards or uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of
Rochester, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on
this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
A. Designation of the Local Administrator. The Commissioner of
Neighborhood and Business Development or his/her designee is hereby
appointed Local Administrator to administer and implement this
chapter by granting or denying floodplain development permits in
accordance with its provisions. [Amended 6-16-2009 by Ord. No.
2009-179]
B. The floodplain development permit.
(1) Purpose. A floodplain development permit is hereby established for
all construction and other development to be undertaken in areas
of special flood hazard in this community for the purpose of
protecting its citizens from increased flood hazards and insuring
that new development is constructed in a manner that minimizes its
exposure to flooding. It shall be unlawful to undertake any
development in an area of special flood hazard, as shown on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map enumerated in § 56-3B, without a valid
floodplain development permit. Application for a permit shall be
made on forms furnished by the Local Administrator and may
include, but not be limited to, plans, in duplicate, drawn to scale
and showing: the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of
the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of
materials, drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing.
(2) Fees. All applications for a floodplain development permit shall be
accompanied by an application fee of $250. In addition, the
applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing the City of Rochester
for any additional costs necessary for review, inspection and
approval of this project. The Local Administrator may require a
deposit of no more than $500 to cover these additional costs.
C. Application for a permit. The applicant shall provide the following
information as appropriate. Additional information may be required on
the permit application form.
(1) The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest
floor (including basement or cellar) of any new or substantially
improved structure to be located in Zone A1-A30, AE or AH or Zone
A if base flood elevation data are available. Upon completion of the
lowest floor, the permittee shall submit to the Local Administrator
§ 56-3 (RESERVED) § 56-4
53:953
the as-built elevation, certified by a licensed professional engineer
or surveyor.
(2) The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which any
new or substantially improved nonresidential structure will be
floodproofed. Upon completion of the floodproofed portion of the
structure, the permittee shall submit to the Local Administrator the
as-built floodproofed elevation, certified by a professional engineer
or surveyor.
(3) A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that
any utility floodproofing will meet the criteria in § 56-5B(3),
Utilities.
(4) A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that
any nonresidential floodproofed structure will meet the
floodproofing criteria in § 56-5D, Nonresidential structures.
(5) A description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development. Computations by
a licensed professional engineer must be submitted that
demonstrate that the altered or relocated segment will provide
equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. The
applicant must submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
to revise the documents enumerated in § 56-3B, when notified by
the Local Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs
assessed by FEMA for this purpose. The applicant must also
provide assurances that the conveyance capacity of the altered or
relocated stream segment will be maintained.
(6) A technical analysis, by a licensed professional engineer, if required
by the Local Administrator, which shows whether proposed
development to be located in an area of special flood hazard may
result in physical damage to any other property.
(7) In Zone A, when no base flood elevation data are available from
other sources, base flood elevation data shall be provided by the
permit applicant for subdivision proposals and other proposed
developments (including proposals for manufactured home and
recreational vehicle parks and subdivisions) that are greater than
either 50 lots or five acres.
D. Duties and responsibilities of the Local Administrator. Duties of the
Local Administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
(1) Permit application review. The Local Administrator shall conduct
the following permit application review before issuing a floodplain
development permit:
§ 56-4 ROCHESTER CODE § 56-4
53:954
(a) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the
requirements of § 56-4C, Application for a permit, and for
compliance with the provisions and standards of this chapter.
(b) Review subdivision and other proposed new development,
including manufactured home parks, to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If
a proposed building site is located in an area of special flood
hazard, all new construction and substantial improvements
shall meet the applicable standards of § 56-5, Construction
standards, and, in particular, § 56-5A(1), Subdivision
proposals.
(c) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of
special flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other
property (e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood
velocities). The Local Administrator may require the applicant
to submit additional technical analyses and data necessary to
complete the determination. If the proposed development may
result in physical damage to any other property or fails to meet
the requirements of § 56-5, Construction standards, no permit
shall be issued. The applicant may revise the application to
include measures that mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects
and resubmit the application.
(d) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from
those governmental agencies from which approval is required
by state or federal law.
(2) Use of other flood data.
(a) When the Federal Emergency Management Agency has
designated areas of special flood hazard on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) but has neither produced
water surface elevation data (these areas are designated Zone
A or V on the FIRM) nor identified a floodway, the Local
Administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any
base flood elevation and floodway data available from a
federal, state or other source, including data developed
pursuant to § 56-4C(7), as criteria for requiring that new
construction, substantial improvements or other proposed
development meets the requirements of this chapter.
(b) When base flood elevation data are not available, the Local
Administrator may use flood information from any other
authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish flood
elevations within the areas of special flood hazard, for the
purposes of this chapter.
(3) Alteration of watercourses.
§ 56-4 (RESERVED) § 56-4
53:955
(a) Notification to adjacent communities and the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation prior to permitting
any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submittal of
evidence of such notification to the Regional Director, Region
II, Federal Emergency Management Agency.
(b) Determine that the permit holder has provided for
maintenance within the altered or relocated portion of said
watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not
diminished.
(4) Construction stage.
(a) In Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood
elevation data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor
or completion of floodproofing of a new or substantially
improved structure, obtain from the permit holder a
certification of the as-built elevation of the lowest floor or
floodproofed elevation, in relation to mean sea level. The
certificate shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision
of a licensed land surveyor or professional engineer and
certified by same. For manufactured homes, the permit holder
shall submit the certificate of elevation upon placement of the
structure on the site. A certificate of elevation must also be
submitted for a recreational vehicle if it remains on a site for
180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is fully licensed and
ready for highway use).
(b) Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval
of the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The
Local Administrator shall review all data submitted.
Deficiencies detected shall be cause to issue a stop-work order
for the project unless immediately corrected.
(5) Inspections. The Local Administrator and/or the developer's
engineer or architect shall make periodic inspections at
appropriate times throughout the period of construction in order to
monitor compliance with permit conditions and enable said
inspector to certify, if requested, that the development is in
compliance with the requirements of the floodplain development
permit and/or any variance provisions.
(6) Stop-work orders.
(a) The Local Administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a
stop-work order for any floodplain development found ongoing
without a development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order
shall subject the violator to the penalties described in § 56-3E
of this chapter.
(b) The Local Administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a
stop-work order for any floodplain development found

(a) In areas of special flood hazard, as determined by documents
enumerated in § 56-3B, it shall be unlawful to occupy or to
permit the use or occupancy of any building or premises, or
both, or part thereof hereafter created, erected, changed,
converted or wholly or partly altered or enlarged in its use or
structure until a certificate of compliance has been issued by
the Local Administrator stating that the building or land
conforms to the requirements of this chapter.
(b) A certificate of compliance shall be issued by the Local
Administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development
in areas of special flood hazard.
