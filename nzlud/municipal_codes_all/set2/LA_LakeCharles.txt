PREFACE 
    Part I of this volume contains the Charter of the City of Lake Charles, Louisiana, as amended, followed by a table of amendments thereto and their disposition. Part II contains the Code of Ordinances of the City of Lake Charles, being a revision and codification of the ordinances of a general and permanent nature of the City of Lake Charles, and the ordinances amendatory thereof and appropriate for inclusion, followed by a comparative table of ordinances and their disposition. 
    Part II of this volume is an entire new codification, and as expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, supersedes all ordinances not included herein or expressly saved from repeal by the Adopting Ordinance. Special ordinances or those dealing with only a portion of the inhabitants of the City, rather than all of them, or relating to special purposes, such as ordinances levying special assessments, providing for bond issues, paving, vacating and opening specified streets, changing street names, granting franchises, etc., are not included herein. For a more specific enumeration of the types of ordinances which are not included herein, see Section 6 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The Code has been republished in 2005 with the inclusion of ordinances received for codification subsequent to the publication of Supplement No. 66 to the 1970 publication through Ord. No. 13196, adopted Oct. 20, 2004. This republication constitutes a replacement volume to the prior Code. 
    The ordinances of the City have been classified as to subject matter, edited, revised and in many instances rewritten. It should be observed that the chapters have been arranged in alphabetical sequence and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Attention is also invited to the footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which also refer to relevant state laws. 
    The source of a section is included in the history note enclosed in parentheses at the end of a section. The absence of a history note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of this Code. 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the tenth section of Chapter 11 is 11-10. Under this system each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections may be inserted in their proper places simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections is to be added between Sections 2-2 and 2-3, they should be numbered as Sections 2-2.1, 2-2.2 and 2-2.3. 
    New chapters may be included by the addition of a fraction after the chapter number, e.g., new material may be included between Chapters 12 and 13, by designating it as Chapter 121/2. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same manner, or in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division, as the case may be. Sections have been reserved at the end of articles and divisions to allow for future expansion. 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
Charter CHT:1 Charter Comparative Table CHTCT:1 Code CD1:1 Code Appendix CDA:1 Code Comparative Tables CCT:1 Charter Index CHTi:1 Code Index CDi:1  
    A special feature of this volume to which the attention of the user is particularly invited is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this looseleaf system, this volume may be kept up-to-date periodically. Amendments to the Charter of the City can be inserted after reprinting the pages affected, adding new pages or deleting pages in case of repeal. Likewise, amendatory ordinances, upon final passage by the City, can be edited and the page or pages affected reprinted for insertion in the Code. In such event, the new or reprinted pages then shall be distributed to the holders of the Codes with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. To each amendment will be attached an amendment or editorial note explaining briefly the effect of the amendment upon the section or sections amended and the derivation of such amendment. Each such subsequent amendment when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof as provided in Section 7 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    Each index entry has been placed under several headings, some being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology and still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index which are intended as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. Additions, alterations and deletions in the index will be accomplished in the same manner as is provided for additions, alterations and deletions to the substantive provisions of this publication. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times depends largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it shall then become the responsibility of the holder to insert the amendments according to the accompanying instructions. It is earnestly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacement, and that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Honorable James E. Sudduth, Mayor, Mr. Charles Ware, Administrative Assistant, and Mr. Robert M. McHale, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance, for the interest shown by them in the preparation of the manuscript of this publication. Credit is gratefully acknowledged also to the members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout this project. 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of George R. Langford, President, and B. Meade White, Editor, of the editorial staff of Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida and is presented for the use and benefit of the citizens of the City of Lake Charles, Louisiana. 
    The republication of the Code was under the direct supervision of Robert S. Hornyak, Editor, and credit is gratefully given to other members of the publisher's staff for their able assistance throughout the project.
